## The Problem

Satellite development requires stable, reliable knowledge. Engineers need to know:

- What actually works (not just what the spec says)
- Why decisions were made
- What's been tried and failed
- What depends on specific conditions

But knowledge degrades:

- Experienced people leave, taking context with them
- Documentation says "what" but not "why" or "how confident to be"
- Lessons learned sit in reports nobody reads
- New engineers can't tell what's reliable vs. what's a guess

**Result:** Steep learning curves, repeated mistakes, and failures that could have been prevented.

---

## The Solution

This library provides structured knowledge extraction and preservation for technical systems, initially focused on CubeSat development with F´ and PROVES Kit.

**Core capability:** Extract knowledge from documentation, tag it with context (where it came from, how reliable it is, what it depends on), and make it queryable so engineers can access stable information across personnel transitions.

**Key features:**

- Natural language queries via MCP server ("What do we know about the MS5611 barometer?")
- Pattern recognition via GraphSAGE neural network (detect hidden couplings, predict cascade risks)
- Full provenance tracking (every piece of knowledge traces back to source)
- Human verification layer (engineers confirm what agents extract)

## How It Works

### 1. Intelligent Source Discovery

```bash
python production/scripts/find_good_urls.py --fprime --proveskit --max-pages 50
```

Smart crawler analyzes documentation quality, identifies high-signal pages, queues for extraction.

### 2. Autonomous Knowledge Extraction

```bash
python production/scripts/process_extractions.py --limit 10
```

Multi-agent system extracts:

- **Components**: Discrete modules (drivers, sensors, boards)
- **Interfaces**: Connection points (I2C bus, SPI, power rails)
- **Flows**: What moves through interfaces (data, power, commands, heat)
- **Dependencies**: What relies on what, under which conditions

Every extraction includes:

- Source reference (documentation URL, line number)
- Context (why this matters, what it depends on)
- Confidence level (verified, likely, assumed)
- Dimensional metadata (how knowledge was obtained, how reliable it is)

### 3. Human Verification

Extracted knowledge appears in Notion for engineer review:

- Agents provide context and confidence scores
- Engineers verify, correct, or reject
- Only verified knowledge enters the accessible graph

**Why this matters:** Systems built on verified engineering knowledge, not agent guesses.

### 4. Natural Language Access (MCP Server)

Query the knowledge graph using natural language:

```python
# Ask questions in plain language
agent = create_agent("claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", mcp_tools)
result = await agent.ainvoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What conflicts with the MS5611 barometer?"}]
})
```

**Multi-layer queries:**

- Content: "Show me all interface requirements for the power system"
- Structure: "What knowledge came from direct testing vs. models?"
- Provenance: "Trace this dependency back to source documentation"

→ **[MCP Integration Guide](mcp-server/docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md)** | **[Quick Start](mcp-server/examples/quick_start_mcp.py)**

### 5. Pattern Recognition (GraphSAGE Neural Network)

Beyond queries, the system learns patterns:

- Predict cascade failures (if power drops, what else fails?)
- Detect hidden couplings (unexpected dependencies between subsystems)
- Suggest testing priorities (which interfaces are most critical?)

**Currently in development:** Graph embedding and neural network training pipeline

→ **[GraphSAGE Implementation](https://github.com/Lizo-RoadTown/Proves_AI)**

### 6. Meta-Learning Improvement

```bash
python production/scripts/improvement_analyzer.py
```

System analyzes its own extraction quality:

- Which sources yield reliable data?
- What extraction patterns lead to verification failures?
- How can the ontology adapt to actual system structure?

**The system improves itself** by learning what works.

## Knowledge Structure

Based on **FRAMES methodology** (Osborn, 2025):

- **Components**: Discrete modules (what exists)
- **Interfaces**: Connection points (where they connect)
- **Flows**: What moves through interfaces (data, power, heat)
- **Mechanisms**: What maintains connections (protocols, documentation, procedures)

Every relationship captures:

1. **Directionality**: Does it flow both ways?
2. **Strength**: Always, sometimes, never?
3. **Mechanism**: Electrical, thermal, timing, protocol?
4. **Knownness**: Verified, assumed, unknown?
5. **Scope**: Under which conditions? (version, hardware revision, mode)

This structure enables both **precise queries** and **pattern learning**.

db = get_db()
db.execute(
    'INSERT INTO urls_to_process (url, source, quality_score) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)',
    ('https://nasa.github.io/fprime/UsersGuide/best/app-man-drv.html', 'smoke_test', 0.95)
)
print('✓ Test URL added to queue')
"

# Run extraction on single URL
python production/scripts/process_extractions.py --limit 1

# View results in staging
python -c "
from neon-database.scripts.db_connector import get_db
db = get_db()
results = db.fetch_all(
    'SELECT candidate_type, candidate_key, confidence_score FROM staging_extractions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5'
)
for r in results:
    print(f'{r[\"candidate_type\"]}: {r[\"candidate_key\"]} (confidence: {r[\"confidence_score\"]})')
"
```

## Design Principles

From [canon/CANON.md](canon/CANON.md):

### 1. Human Verification Layer

Agents extract and categorize, but humans establish truth. This separation ensures the knowledge graph reflects verified physics, not LLM hallucinations.

### 2. Truth Layer Architecture

> "Agents provide context. Humans establish truth."

```text
Raw Sources → Agent Capture → Agent Staging → Human Verification → Truth Graph
     ↑              ↑               ↑                ↑
  (all data)   (categorize)    (flag/context)   (align/verify)
```

### 3. Five-Attribute Edge Model

Every relationship has:

1. **Directionality**: Does it flow both ways?
2. **Strength**: Always, sometimes, never?
3. **Mechanism**: Electrical, thermal, timing, protocol, software state?
4. **Knownness**: Known (verified), assumed, unknown, disproved?
5. **Scope**: Version tuple, hardware revision, mission profile?

This granularity lets the GNN learn **conditional dependencies** and **mode-specific behavior**.
