## Overview

This repository builds a knowledge graph from technical documentation (F´, PROVES Kit, CubeSat hardware) to train a GraphSAGE neural network for predicting cascade failures in space systems.

**The problem**: Graph Neural Networks need high-quality training data. Missing edges, inconsistent labels, and unverified relationships teach the model wrong patterns.

**Our approach**: Multi-agent extraction pipeline with full lineage tracking, human verification, and a five-attribute edge model that captures conditional dependencies.

### Why GraphSAGE?

GraphSAGE (Graph Sample and Aggregate) learns from both node features and graph structure, making it suitable for predicting how changes propagate through coupled systems (power → thermal → timing → software).

We're using NASA's heterogeneous GNN implementation as a foundation, initially focused on CubeSat systems with potential application to other technical domains with verifiable dependency graphs.

---

## What We've Built

A multi-agent extraction pipeline that:

1. **Crawls documentation** - Identifies high-quality technical pages (find_good_urls.py)
2. **Extracts structure** - LLM agents identify components, interfaces, flows using FRAMES ontology (process_extractions.py)
3. **Validates lineage** - Tracks every extraction back to source with evidence checksums
4. **Routes for review** - Staged extractions go to human verification via project management integration
5. **Analyzes patterns** - Meta-learning loop identifies extraction quality issues (improvement_analyzer.py)

**What makes this different from standard knowledge graphs**: Five-attribute edges (directionality, strength, mechanism, knownness, scope) that let the GNN learn conditional relationships, not just binary connections.

### Current Phase: Graph Embedding Pipeline

We're currently in the **chunking and embedding phase** - preparing the knowledge graph for neural network training:

### 🎯 Current Work: Representation Before Interpretation

**Inference is intentionally deferred until after knowledge has been represented without interpretation.** This separation enables an embodiment-aware chunking strategy, where chunks are formed based on observed structural boundaries and relationships rather than inferred meaning or semantic similarity.

This design ensures that chunking reflects **how the system is described**, not how it is prematurely understood. Inference and meaning-making are introduced only after stable representation is established.

#### The Inference-Embodiment Boundary

**Inference** refers to knowledge that is already expressible symbolically (text, equations, specifications) and can be directly operated on by an AI system. All AI reasoning occurs in this space.

**Embodiment** refers to knowledge that exists through physical interaction, practice, intuition, or lived experience, and is not natively symbolic. For humans, many domains are primarily embodied rather than inferential.

**Domains differ in where the inference–embodiment boundary lies:**

- Domains that are already largely inferential (software APIs, protocol specs) are straightforward to extract and chunk
- Domains that are highly embodied (brownout behavior under load, thermal coupling in vacuum) make **extraction the primary challenge**, not chunking

**This pipeline treats chunking as a boundary operation**: domain knowledge remains purely inferential up to chunk formation. A central open problem we're addressing is whether embodied knowledge can be extracted in a way that preserves meaning while remaining universally translatable—what we call **embodied inference**.

The agents autonomously:
- Find documentation pages (production/scripts/find_good_urls.py)
- Extract dependency candidates (production/scripts/process_extractions.py)
- Flag quality issues and suggest improvements (production/scripts/improvement_analyzer.py)
- Sync to Notion for human truth establishment
- Build verified graph nodes and edges with full lineage

---

## How It Works: Agent → Graph → Neural Network

### 1. Intelligent Source Discovery

```bash
python production/scripts/find_good_urls.py --fprime --proveskit --max-pages 50
```

Smart crawler analyzes documentation quality, finds high-signal pages, queues for extraction.

### 2. Autonomous Extraction

```bash
python production/scripts/process_extractions.py --limit 10
```

Multi-agent system (Extractor → Validator → Storage) extracts:
- **Components**: Discrete modules (drivers, sensors, boards)
- **Interfaces**: Connection points (I2C bus, SPI, power rails)
- **Flows**: What moves through interfaces (data, power, commands, heat)
- **Mechanisms**: What maintains connections (protocols, documentation, tests)

**NOT** "Component A depends on Component B" (too vague)
**YES** "RadioTX CONSUMES PowerRail_3V3 via electrical mechanism, sometimes (during TX), knownness: verified"

### 3. Human Truth Layer

Extracted candidates appear in Notion for human review:
- Agents provide rich context and confidence scores
- Humans verify evidence and align across conflicting sources
- Only human-verified data enters the truth graph

**Why this matters**: The GNN learns from verified physics, not agent guesses.

### 4. Meta-Learning Improvement

```bash
python production/scripts/improvement_analyzer.py
```

System analyzes extraction patterns:
- Which sources yield high-quality data?
- What extraction patterns lead to validation failures?
- How can ontology adapt to graph structure?
- What methodology improvements would increase accuracy?

**The agent is training itself** to become better at preparing GNN training data.

### 5. Graph Embedding (Current Phase)

The verified knowledge graph gets:
- **Chunked**: Into trainable subgraphs
- **Embedded**: Node and edge features vectorized
- **Indexed**: In pgvector database for efficient retrieval
- **Fed**: To GraphSAGE model for training

## Why Data Quality Defines GNN Success

| Bad Data In | Bad Predictions Out |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Missing edges | Model can't learn cascade paths |
| Inconsistent labels | Signal drowns in noise |
| No lineage | Impossible to debug failures |
| Unverified "facts" | Model learns hallucinations |

| Verified Data In | Reliable Predictions Out |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Complete subgraphs | Model learns full cascade chains |
| Consistent ontology | Clear training signal |
| Full provenance | Debuggable, improvable |
| Human-verified truth | Model learns real physics |

**Our obsession**: Lineage, verification, provenance. Every graph edge traces to source code, documentation, or test results.

## Design Principles

From [canon/CANON.md](canon/CANON.md):

### 1. Human Verification Layer

Agents extract and categorize, but humans establish truth. This separation ensures the knowledge graph reflects verified physics, not LLM hallucinations.

### 2. Truth Layer Architecture

> "Agents provide context. Humans establish truth."

```
Raw Sources → Agent Capture → Agent Staging → Human Verification → Truth Graph
     ↑              ↑               ↑                ↑
  (all data)   (categorize)    (flag/context)   (align/verify)
```

### 3. FRAMES Ontology (Foundational)

Based on "FRAMES: A Structural Diagnostic for Resilience in Modular University Space Programs" (Osborn, 2025):

- **Components**: Discrete modules (what exists)
- **Interfaces**: Connection points (where they touch)
- **Flows**: What moves through interfaces (data, power, heat, signals)
- **Mechanisms**: What maintains connections (protocols, docs, processes)
- **Coupling**: Strength of bonds (measured via graph edge attributes)

**The fundamental question**: "What MOVES through this system, and through which interfaces?"

NOT: "What depends on what?" (human judgment assigns criticality AFTER understanding structure)

### 4. Five-Attribute Edge Model

Every relationship has:
1. **Directionality**: Does it flow both ways?
2. **Strength**: Always, sometimes, never?
3. **Mechanism**: Electrical, thermal, timing, protocol, software state?
4. **Knownness**: Known (verified), assumed, unknown, disproved?
5. **Scope**: Version tuple, hardware revision, mission profile?

This granularity lets the GNN learn **conditional dependencies** and **mode-specific behavior**.
