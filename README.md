## The Meta-Problem

Modern systems are built from fragmented knowledge across incompatible sources:
- **Documentation lives everywhere** - wikis, PDFs, READMEs, Slack, tribal knowledge
- **Systems don't compose** - different assumptions, units, naming conventions, versions
- **Dependencies are hidden** - changes cascade unpredictably, failures emerge from interactions
- **Risk is invisible** - you can't assess what you can't model

This isn't just a CubeSat problem. It's a **knowledge integration problem** that affects:
- **Enterprise systems** - Siloed documentation, undocumented APIs, orphaned code
- **Supply chains** - Fragmented vendor data, hidden dependencies, cascading failures
- **Medical knowledge** - Multiple databases, incompatible ontologies, missing links
- **Scientific research** - Literature across disciplines, incompatible methodologies
- **Software ecosystems** - Transitive dependencies, version conflicts, breaking changes

**The challenge:** How do you take unstructured, fragmented knowledge and build a composable, provably-correct knowledge graph that reveals hidden relationships and enables risk assessment?

---

## Theoretical Foundation: Nearly Decomposable Systems

Our approach is grounded in **Herbert Simon's theory of nearly decomposable systems** - complex systems that can be analyzed as subsystems with specific interaction patterns.

### Three-Layer Dependency Model

We track dependencies across three layers simultaneously:

1. **Digital Layer** - Code, APIs, protocols, data flows
   - Example: "I2C driver function calls power management API"

2. **Organizational Layer** - Teams, processes, documentation, knowledge transfer
   - Example: "Team A's code changes require Team B's review due to shared I2C bus"

3. **Physical Layer** - Hardware, sensors, actuators, physical constraints
   - Example: "MSP430 GPIO pin physically connected to RP2350 wake signal"

### Rich Dependency Types

Rather than simple "A depends on B", we capture:

- **Interfaces** - How subsystems communicate (API calls, message passing, shared state)
- **Couplings** - Strength and type of interaction (tight/loose, synchronous/asynchronous)
- **Bonds** - Dependencies that hold the system together (power, timing, data flow)

Each dependency is characterized by:
- **Type** - depends_on, enables, conflicts_with, mitigates, causes
- **Layer** - digital, organizational, physical
- **Strength** - tight coupling (failure cascades) vs loose coupling (isolated failures)
- **Direction** - unidirectional, bidirectional, cyclic

### Why This Matters

**Nearly decomposable systems theory** explains why hidden dependencies cause failures:
- Systems appear independent (subsystems are "nearly" decomposable)
- But they interact through subtle cross-layer dependencies
- Changes in one subsystem cascade unpredictably to others
- Traditional documentation captures only obvious dependencies within one layer

**Our solution:** Build a multi-layer dependency graph that reveals the hidden coupling structure, enabling:
- **Risk assessment** - Predict failure cascades from proposed changes
- **Impact analysis** - Identify all affected subsystems across layers
- **Optimization** - Reduce tight coupling, strengthen critical bonds
- **GNN training** - Learn patterns in how dependencies cause failures

This transforms the dependency graph from a static knowledge base into a **predictive model** of system behavior.

---

## Our Solution: Truth Layer Architecture

We've built a **knowledge graph construction pipeline** with three innovations:

### 1. Cryptographic Lineage Tracking
Every extracted entity is provably traceable to its source with:
- **UUID chains** - snapshot_id → extraction_id → entity_id
- **SHA256 checksums** - Evidence integrity verification
- **Byte offset tracking** - Exact source location in original document
- **Lineage confidence scoring** - 0.0 to 1.0 confidence that extraction is traceable

**Result:** Mathematical certainty that knowledge came from documented sources, not hallucination.

### 2. Forward-Looking Relationship Extraction
We capture relationships **before** all entities exist:
- **Staging relationships** - "Component A depends on Component B" stored even if B isn't extracted yet
- **Auto-resolution** - When B is later extracted, relationship automatically links
- **Text-to-ID matching** - Fuzzy matching between text references and entity keys
- **Prepares for GNN** - Graph neural network for risk modeling

**Result:** Build a complete dependency graph even from incomplete knowledge.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Truth Layer
Progressive refinement with human verification:
```
Raw Sources → AI Extraction → Validation → Human Review → Truth Graph
```

- **Capture ALL** - LLM agents extract entities, interfaces, flows, mechanisms (FRAMES methodology)
- **Validate lineage** - Verify every extraction traces to source
- **Human gate** - Nothing enters truth graph without human approval
- **Continuous improvement** - Curator observes patterns, suggests optimizations

**Result:** AI speed with human correctness - agents learn from every decision.

## What We've Built

### Phase 1: Lineage Tracking System ✅
**Problem:** LLMs hallucinate. How do you trust extracted knowledge?

**Solution:** Cryptographic verification chain
- SHA256 checksums for evidence integrity
- Byte offset tracking for exact source location
- 5-level verification (extraction exists → snapshot linked → evidence found → checksums match → lineage verified)
- Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) - honest assessment of traceability

**Implementation:**
- Database migration adding 14 lineage columns ([migrations/001_add_lineage_and_relationships.sql](curator-agent/migrations/001_add_lineage_and_relationships.sql))
- Retroactive verification of existing data ([retroactive_verify_lineage.py](curator-agent/retroactive_verify_lineage.py))
- Complete design document ([ID_LINEAGE_SYSTEM.md](curator-agent/ID_LINEAGE_SYSTEM.md))

### Phase 2: Rich Dependency Extraction ✅
**Problem:** Dependencies exist before all entities are extracted. How do you capture them with full context?

**Solution:** Forward-looking relationship staging with multi-layer dependency characterization
- `staging_relationships` table stores relationships with text references
- Captures **interfaces, couplings, and bonds** (nearly decomposable systems framework)
- Tracks **layer** (digital, organizational, physical) and **strength** (tight/loose coupling)
- Auto-resolution trigger matches text to entities when extracted
- Tracks resolution status (unresolved → partially_resolved → resolved)
- Handles ambiguity (multiple possible matches flagged for human review)

**Enables:**
- **Rich dependency graph** - Not just "A depends on B" but type, layer, strength, direction
- **Cross-layer analysis** - Reveal hidden dependencies that span digital/org/physical boundaries
- **GNN preparation** - Training data for predictive models (risk, impact, optimization)
- **Nearly decomposable systems analysis** - Identify tight coupling that causes failure cascades

### Phase 3: Notion Human-in-the-Loop ✅
**Problem:** How do you give humans oversight without slowing down the pipeline?

**Solution:** Three-database Notion integration
1. **Extraction Review** - Human verification of every entity before truth graph
2. **Error Log** - Agent error tracking for pattern analysis (20 properties)
3. **Curator Observations** - Oversight reports on efficiency, cost optimization, limitations

**Curator Workflow:**
- **Daily (5 min):** Check errors, generate metrics summary
- **Weekly (15 min):** Trend analysis, identify optimization opportunities
- **As-needed:** Custom observations (tool gaps, restrictions, optimization opportunities)

## Current Application: CubeSat Failure Prevention

We're applying this to prevent CubeSat mission failures (88% failure rate):

**The Problem:**
- University CubeSat programs have fragmented knowledge across teams
- Hidden dependencies cause cascading failures
- Example: Power management change breaks I2C sensors 2 weeks before launch → 6-month delay

**Our Approach:**
1. Extract entities from documentation (components, interfaces, flows, mechanisms)
2. Build dependency graph with lineage tracking
3. Human verification before truth graph
4. Future: GNN predicts failure cascades from proposed changes

**Trial Results:**
- Analyzed F' I2C Driver (411 lines) + PROVES Kit Power Management (154 lines)
- Found **45+ dependencies** with exact line citations
- Discovered **4 critical cross-system dependencies** undocumented in either system
- Identified **5 major knowledge gaps** (timing specs, voltage requirements, error recovery)

**This proves the methodology works.** The next step is scaling it to 60 pages of documentation, then generalizing to other domains.

---

## Why This Matters

### The Generalization Path

**Phase 1 (Current):** CubeSat documentation → Knowledge graph
- Proves: Extraction works, lineage is verifiable, human oversight scales

**Phase 2 (Next):** Multi-ecosystem composition
- Example: Integrate PROVES Kit + F' Prime + custom hardware
- Challenge: Different naming conventions, units, assumptions
- Solution: Entity aliasing + semantic matching + human disambiguation

**Phase 3 (Future):** Cross-domain knowledge integration
- Apply to: Medical databases, supply chains, software ecosystems
- Requirement: Domain-specific extraction prompts, but same pipeline
- Output: Composable knowledge graphs with provable lineage

**Phase 4 (Vision):** Automated risk assessment
- GNN trained on verified relationships
- Predicts: "Changing X will break Y with Z% confidence"
- Human validation: Correct predictions improve model, errors get flagged

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- API keys: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [Neon PostgreSQL](https://neon.tech/)
- (Optional) [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for human review interface

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Lizo-RoadTown/PROVES_LIBRARY.git
cd PROVES_LIBRARY

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Initialize database
cd curator-agent
python -c "
import psycopg, os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('../.env')
conn = psycopg.connect(os.environ['NEON_DATABASE_URL'])
with open('migrations/001_add_lineage_and_relationships.sql') as f:
    conn.execute(f.read())
conn.commit()
print('Database schema initialized')
"

# Run extraction
python daily_extraction.py  # Extracts from first page

# (Optional) Set up Notion human review
# Follow: curator-agent/NOTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```

### Verify Setup

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Deep Agents Pattern (LangGraph)
Sub-agents wrapped as tools for context isolation:

```python
@tool("extractor_agent")
def call_extractor(page_url: str) -> dict:
    """Extract entities from documentation page."""
    # Extractor runs in isolated thread
    # Returns: entities with evidence and confidence
    return extractor.invoke({"url": page_url})
```

**Benefits:**
- Specialized agents (extractor, validator, storage)
- Cost optimization (cheap models for simple tasks)
- Parallel execution where possible

### 2. Lineage Verification Algorithm

```python
def verify_lineage(extraction_id):
    checks_passed = []

    # Check 1: Extraction exists in database
    # Check 2: Snapshot exists and is linked (foreign key)
    # Check 3: Evidence quote exists in snapshot payload (byte-level)
    # Check 4: Evidence checksum matches
    # Check 5: Snapshot checksum valid

    lineage_confidence = len(checks_passed) / total_checks
    return lineage_confidence  # 0.0 to 1.0
```

**Honest assessment:**
- 1.0 = Perfect lineage (all checks pass)
- 0.67 = Partial verification (e.g., retroactive extractions with summaries instead of exact quotes)
- <0.5 = Failed verification (requires re-extraction or mandatory review)

### 3. Forward-Looking Relationships

```sql
CREATE TABLE staging_relationships (
  src_extraction_id UUID,  -- Nullable (might not exist yet)
  src_text_ref TEXT,       -- "MSP430FR Microcontroller"
  dst_extraction_id UUID,  -- Nullable
  dst_text_ref TEXT,       -- "RP2350 Processor"
  rel_type TEXT,           -- "controls", "depends_on", etc.
  resolution_status TEXT   -- 'unresolved', 'partially_resolved', 'resolved'
);

-- Auto-resolution trigger
CREATE TRIGGER auto_resolve
  AFTER INSERT ON staging_extractions
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION match_text_refs_to_new_entity();
```

**Enables:**
- Capture relationships before all entities extracted
- Build complete dependency graph incrementally
- Handle ambiguity (multiple possible matches → human review)

### Trial Results (Manual Analysis)

| System | Lines Analyzed | Dependencies Found | Critical Cross-System Deps | Knowledge Gaps |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| F' I2C Driver | 411 | 25+ | 4 | 3 |
| PROVES Power Mgmt | 154 | 20+ | 4 | 2 |
| **Combined** | **565** | **45+** | **4** | **5** |

**Critical Finding:** 4 dependencies existed **only when both systems were considered together** - undocumented in either system individually.

**This is exactly the hidden dependency problem we're solving.**

### Graph Neural Network for Predictive Modeling

The rich multi-layer dependency graph becomes training data for multiple types of predictive models.

**Why Rich Dependencies Enable Better Models:**

Traditional dependency graphs store "A depends on B" as a binary edge. Our graph captures:

- **Type** (depends_on, enables, conflicts_with, mitigates, causes)
- **Layer** (digital, organizational, physical)
- **Strength** (tight coupling → failure cascades, loose coupling → isolated failures)
- **Direction** (unidirectional, bidirectional, cyclic)

These become **feature vectors** for the GNN, enabling it to learn:

- *"Tight digital coupling + organizational dependency → 85% cascade probability"*
- *"Physical bond + loose digital coupling → safe to modify"*
- *"Bidirectional dependency + high strength → critical bond, must maintain"*

**Model Types We'll Train:**

1. **Risk Prediction Model**
   - Input: Proposed change to entity X
   - Output: Probability distribution of failure cascades to entities Y, Z, W...
   - Training: Historical failures with known cascades
   - Validation: Predict known incidents, measure precision/recall

2. **Impact Analysis Model**
   - Input: Modified entity + modification type
   - Output: All affected subsystems ranked by impact severity, grouped by layer
   - Training: Change logs + downstream effects
   - Validation: Against documented integration issues

3. **Coupling Optimization Model**
   - Input: Current dependency graph
   - Output: Recommended decoupling actions ranked by risk reduction
   - Training: Successful refactorings that reduced failures
   - Validation: Simulate changes, measure coupling metrics

4. **Cross-Layer Dependency Discovery**
   - Input: Known dependencies in 1-2 layers
   - Output: Predicted hidden dependencies in other layers
   - Training: Complete multi-layer graphs
   - Validation: Against expert-identified dependencies

**GNN Architecture Guided by Nearly Decomposable Systems:**

Herbert Simon's theory suggests:

- Subsystems have **strong internal coupling** (within subsystems)
- Subsystems have **weak cross-coupling** (between subsystems)
- But these weak couplings cause **unexpected cascades**

Our GNN architecture reflects this:

- **Node features:** Entity type, layer memberships, centrality
- **Edge features:** Type, layer, strength, direction (the rich dependency data)
- **Graph attention:** Learn which weak couplings matter most
- **Multi-layer message passing:** Propagate information across digital/org/physical layers
- **Cascade prediction:** Model failure propagation paths through weak cross-couplings

> **Live Implementation:** The GNN stack is under active development at [Proves_AI](https://github.com/Lizo-RoadTown/Proves_AI)

**Implementation Roadmap:**

- [ ] Build training dataset from verified dependency graph
- [ ] Train GNN on rich dependency features (type, layer, strength, direction)
- [ ] Implement risk prediction model (failure cascade forecasting)
- [ ] Validate predictions against CubeSat historical failures
- [ ] Expand to impact analysis and optimization models
- [ ] Measure precision/recall/F1 for each model type
- [ ] Publish results comparing binary edges vs rich dependencies

**Why This Matters:**

A dependency graph with only "A depends on B" can tell you *what* is connected.

A rich multi-layer dependency graph with type/layer/strength/direction can tell you:

- **Why** they're connected (enables, depends_on, conflicts_with)
- **How tightly** they're coupled (predicts cascade probability)
- **At what level** the coupling exists (digital code? organizational process? physical wire?)
- **What happens if you break it** (tight coupling → cascades, loose → safe)

This transforms the graph from a **static knowledge base** into a **predictive model** of system behavior - exactly what's needed for risk assessment and failure prevention.

### Generalization
- [ ] Apply to second domain (software ecosystem? medical knowledge?)
- [ ] Refine methodology for cross-domain use
- [ ] Publish results
- [ ] Open-source complete pipeline

## Acknowledgments

This project demonstrates a methodology for knowledge integration across fragmented systems:

- LLM extraction with cryptographic lineage verification
- Multi-layer dependency modeling grounded in nearly decomposable systems theory
- Human-in-the-loop truth validation at scale
- Forward-looking relationship extraction enabling composition before complete knowledge

The knowledge graph is the foundation. The real contribution is demonstrating that we can integrate fragmented knowledge at scale with provable correctness, revealing hidden dependencies that cause system failures.

This methodology is generalizable beyond CubeSats to any domain facing knowledge fragmentation: enterprise systems, supply chains, medical knowledge, or scientific research.
