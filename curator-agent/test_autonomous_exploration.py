Autonomous Deep Agent Exploration Test

This test gives the curator agent an open-ended task to:
1. Explore the existing trial mapping results
2. Understand the ontology and research goals
3. Decide what to do next (replicate, improve, or find new files)
4. Execute autonomously using sub-agents

    # Open-ended task that gives the agent autonomy
    task = """
You are the curator agent for the PROVES Library - a knowledge graph system for CubeSat mission safety.

YOUR MISSION: Explore the repository and decide what dependency extraction work should be done next.

AVAILABLE RESOURCES:
1. Trial mapping results: ../trial_docs/COMPREHENSIVE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
   - Manual analysis of F' I2C Driver and PROVES Kit Power Management
   - Found 45+ dependencies, 4 critical cross-system dependencies

2. Source documentation:
   - ../trial_docs/fprime_i2c_driver_full.md
   - ../trial_docs/proves_kit_power_mgmt_full.md

3. Research goals and ontology:
   - ../docs/ROADMAP.md
   - ../docs/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SCHEMA.md
   - ../FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md

YOUR TASK:
Analyze what's been done and decide the best next step:

Option A: Replicate the trial mapping using your extraction sub-agent
  - Extract dependencies from fprime_i2c_driver_full.md
  - Compare automated extraction vs manual analysis
  - Validate against existing knowledge graph

Option B: Find new files to process
  - Search for other documentation in the repository
  - Identify high-value files for dependency extraction
  - Process them using your sub-agents

Option C: Improve the ontologyt
  - Review the ERV (Engineering Relationship Vocabulary)
  - Suggest improvements based on the trial results
  - Propose new relationship types or validation rules

YOU DECIDE: Use your sub-agents to execute your chosen approach.

Think step-by-step and explain your reasoning.
