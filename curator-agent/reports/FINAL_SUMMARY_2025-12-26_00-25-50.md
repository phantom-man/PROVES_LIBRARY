## Insights & Recommendations

### What Worked Well
- Incremental extraction strategy
- Human verification at each step
- Phase-based prioritization

### Areas for Improvement

### Next Steps
1. Review all failed pages and determine root cause
2. Analyze confidence score trends - did they improve over time?
3. Export verified entities to knowledge graph visualization
4. Begin next phase: F' Prime documentation extraction

## Bootstrapping Strategy Results

This extraction was part of a bootstrapping strategy to build a verified corpus for agent confidence calibration.

**Hypothesis:** As verified corpus grows (pages 1-10), agent confidence scores should rise and human corrections should decrease.

**To Validate:**
1. Plot confidence scores over time
2. Track human decision rates (accept/reject/correct %)
3. Analyze reasoning_trail quality evolution
