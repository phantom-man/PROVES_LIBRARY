# Progress Report
**Generated:** 2025-12-30 13:10:43
**Source log:** testing_data/dataset_97e5e162-967f-4399-9037-a9bd1b8cbf6e.jsonl
**Scope:** Trial-run extraction logs (agent runs, not the production extraction pipeline)

---

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes **agent trial logs** (agents learning to run and record extractions), which is fundamentally different from the **data extraction progress report** that reflects the production pipeline and staged data. The trial-run log includes **3 unique extraction runs** across **3 source pages**, totaling **34 couplings**. All runs report lineage_verified true in their summaries, but this is agent-reported and still requires human review. The legacy progress tracker in `testing_data/extraction_progress.json` still shows **1 completed page with 6 extractions**, so public status should reference this log only when explicitly talking about trial-run activity.

## 1. Trial Run Coverage

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Dataset records 30]
    B[Unique extraction runs 3]
    C[Source pages 3]
    D[Couplings extracted 34]
    E[Lineage flagged true 3]
    A --> B --> C --> D --> E
```

**Key insights:**
- Trial-run coverage is limited to three source pages, so extraction breadth remains narrow.
- Lineage flags are present in the log, but they are not yet human-verified.

## 2. Couplings by Source Page

```mermaid
pie title Couplings by source page n=34
    "Fprime code style" : 15
    "PROVES kit flatsat testing" : 12
    "Fprime dynamic memory" : 7
```

**Key insights:**
- Fprime documentation dominates the current trial runs.
- PROVES kit testing content contributes a meaningful share of couplings.

## 3. Evidence Map

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Legacy progress file]
    B[Completed pages 1]
    C[Extractions 6]
    D[Trial run log]
    E[Couplings 34]
    A --> B --> C
    D --> E
```

**Key insights:**
- The trial-run log is the only place where counts above 6 are currently verifiable.
- Any public claim beyond the legacy tracker should reference the trial log and this report.
