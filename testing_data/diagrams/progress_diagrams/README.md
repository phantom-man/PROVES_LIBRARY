# Progress Diagrams

This folder contains visual progress reports generated by the meta-analysis agent.

## Purpose

The meta-analysis agent reads the current state of the PROVES Library system and generates mermaid diagrams that visualize:

- Current extraction progress and data quality
- Emerging node and relationship patterns
- Data cleaning needs and opportunities
- System evolution over time
- Database insights and trends

## Diagram Types

### System State Diagrams
- **extraction_progress.md** - Current extraction pipeline status
- **data_quality.md** - Quality metrics and issues
- **node_relationship_map.md** - Emerging graph structure

### Trend Diagrams
- **extraction_trends.md** - How extraction quality evolves
- **coverage_gaps.md** - What areas need more data

### Insight Diagrams
- **pattern_discoveries.md** - New patterns found in the data
- **methodology_improvements.md** - Agent learning insights

## Generation

Run the meta-analysis agent:

```bash
python testing/scripts/generate_progress_report.py
```

This agent:
1. Reads README.md, CANON.md, ONTOLOGY.md for context
2. Queries the Neon database for current data state
3. Analyzes the codebase structure
4. Generates mermaid diagrams following MERMAID_RULES.md
5. Saves reports to this folder

## Rules

All diagrams must follow [docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md](../../docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md) for proper rendering.
