Avoiding dynamic memory allocation also avoids the problem of what to do in the case of a failed allocation. However, sometimes dynamic allocation provides for a simpler or more efficient solution. Safe dynamic allocation is available using the buffer manager pattern in F´. In short, this pattern allows components to dynamically allocate memory through a port call to a component designed to manage memory for the system. There are three steps in this process: Call allocation port receiving an Fw::Buffer Use allocated in the Fw::Buffer Call deallocation port providing the Fw::Buffer Component Setup and Buffer Usage This section will describe the work done within a component to allocate, use, and deallocate buffers. Allocating and Deallocating Fw::Buffer s Allocation and deallocation are done through port calls to a buffer managing component. The component needing dynamic memory allocation should include two output ports: Output port of type Fw::BufferGet to request a buffer Output port of type Fw::BufferSend to deallocate the requested buffer. In the case that allocation fails, the Fw::Buffer return from the Fw::BufferGet port will have a size of zero. Developers must check that the size is not smaller than requested before proceeding to use the memory. In the example below, the ports are called allocate and deallocate . First the port definitions are presented followed by the usage in C++. Example Component Definition @ Allocation port for a buffer output port allocate: Fw.BufferGet @ Deallocation port for buffers output port deallocate: Fw.BufferSend @ Allocation failed event event MemoryAllocationFailed() severity warning low id 0 format \"Failed to allocate memory\" Example Component Allocation and Deallocation ... const U32 needed_size = 1024 ; Fw :: Buffer my_buffer = this -&gt; allocate_out ( 0 , needed_size ); if ( my_buffer . getSize () &lt; needed_size ) { this -&gt; deallocate_out ( 0 , my_buffer ); this -&gt; log_WARNING_LO_MemoryAllocationFailed (); } else { ... ... this -&gt; deallocate_out ( 0 , my_buffer ); } Working With F´ Buffers Fw::Buffer objects function as a wrapper for generic memory regions. They consist of a pointer to memory and the size of the memory region pointed to by the pointer. An easy way to work with an Fw::Buffer is to use the serialization representation of the buffer. This allows users to serialize and deserialize from the buffer’s data using methods. To use this method, get a representation using the Fw::Buffer.getSerializeRepr() and then call .serialize() or .deserialize() on the returned object. Example Using Serialization and Deserialization Methods U32 my_value = 123 ; Fw :: Buffer my_buffer = ...; my_buffer . getSerializeRepr (). serialize ( mv_value ); U32 my_value_again = 0 ; my_buffer . getSerializeRepr (). deserialize ( mv_value_again ); Note: To use this method types must inherit from Fw::Serializable or be basic types. Users can access the Fw::Buffer ’s data directly using Fw::Buffer.getData() , which will return a U8* pointer to the buffer’s memory. Care should be taken as this is a raw pointer and thus buffer overruns are possible. Example Using Raw Data Fw :: Buffer my_buffer = ...; U8 * const data = my_buffer . getData (); FW_ASSERT ( my_buffer . getSize () &gt;= 4 ); // Prevent overrun on next line data [ 3 ] = 1 ; Full Fw::Buffer documentation is available here . Topology Consideration There are several components designed to allow for memory allocation and they differ in terms of complexity and use cases. They both support the Fw::BufferGet and Fw::BufferSend port interface for allocation and deallocation and thus can be used interchangeably subject to the descriptions in this section. Each section will describe any special setup needed in the topology and how to hook up the manager’s ports. Svc.StaticMemory Svc.StaticMemory uses a stack-based pool of memory to support allocation. This pool is composed of fixed-size regions each of which is tied to a specific client. Each client’s allocation must be deallocated before a subsequent request by the same client. Since allocation and deallocation ports are port arrays, each client’s allocation and deallocation ports must be hooked up in parallel. This component is designed for simplicity of implementation. System memory usage is always the number of clients multiplied by the size of the memory regions. This memory is allocated as a large array on the stack. Valid memory allocations will always be returned or a software error will be tripped. Svc.StaticMemory is described in more detail here . When To Use Svc.StaticMemory Use Svc.StaticMemory in situations where memory must always be available and sharing or efficient use of memory is a concern. Svc.StaticMemory is typically not suitable for situations where asynchronous memory handling occurs between allocation and deallocation. Usage Requirements Since this component is designed to be simple, its usage has several caveats. These caveats are, for the most part, enforced by assertions, and thus failure to abide by them will result in software termination. Allocations will always return with the size of Svc::StaticMemoryConfig::STATIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_SIZE Allocations above Svc::StaticMemoryConfig::STATIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_SIZE is considered an error It is an error for a client to allocate memory before deallocating previously allocated memory These rules imply that memory allocated from Svc.StaticMemory should never be sent through an asynchronous port as this will risk violating item 3. Connections All connections to Svc.StaticMemory are done using parallel port indices per-client. This is shown in the Topology snippet shown below: client1.allocate -&gt; my_static_memory.bufferAllocate[0] client1.deallocate -&gt; my_static_memory.bufferDeallocate[0] client2.allocate -&gt; my_static_memory.bufferAllocate[1] client2.deallocate -&gt; my_static_memory.bufferDeallocate[1] Svc.StaticMemory does not use any other ports. Please review the configuration to ensure that sufficient regions are available for the number of clients used. Configuration and Setup Allocation region size is configured in the StaticMemoryConfig.hpp header using the STATIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_SIZE value and maximum client number is configured in AcConstants.fpp using the StaticMemoryAllocations value. No other configuration or setup is necessary. Svc.BufferManager Svc.BufferManager uses multiple bins of memory with fixed-size sub-allocations within a bin. It has a single allocate and deallocate port that may take any size allocation request. Svc.BufferManager searches all bins with sub-allocation size larger than the request for an available buffer, which it then marks as used and returns. There is no restriction on the ordering of calls for allocation and deallocation. Clients may have multiple outstanding allocations and thus asynchronous usage of these allocations is supported. Svc.BufferManager is described in more detail here . When To Use Svc.BufferManager Svc.BufferManager must be used when asynchronous handling of memory is needed or sharing of memory is desired. It can be used generically but comes at the cost of complexity of implementation and setup. Usage Requirements Allocating more memory than available will result in buffers with size 0 being returned and is not an error. However, buffers must be allocated and returned using the same instance of Svc.BufferManager. Buffer manager will assert under the following conditions: A returned buffer has the incorrect manager ID (returned to the wrong instance). A returned buffer has an incorrect buffer ID (invalid buffer returned). A returned buffer is returned with a correct buffer ID but hasn’t already been allocated. A returned buffer has an indicated size larger than originally allocated. A returned buffer has a pointer outside the region originally allocated. Connections All connections to Svc.BufferManager can be done using the single pair of allocate and deallocate ports. This is shown in the following snippet of a topology: client1.allocate -&gt; my_buffer_manager.bufferGetCallee client1.deallocate -&gt; my_buffer_manager.bufferSendIn client2.allocate -&gt; my_buffer_manager.bufferGetCallee client2.deallocate -&gt; my_buffer_manager.bufferSendIn The buffer manager should also be hooked up to a rate group used to downlink telemetry and it requires standard telemetry, events, and time connections. Configuration and Setup The number of sub allocations is configured in the BufferManagerComponentImplCfg.hpp header using the BUFFERMGR_MAX_NUM_BINS value. When using Svc.BufferManager the Svc::BufferManagerComponentImpl.setup() method must be called supplying a U16 manager ID, a buffer id, an implementation of Fw::MemAllocator used to allocate memory for the sub-allocations, and a Svc::BufferManagerComponentImpl::BufferBins struct configuring the sub allocations. The Svc::BufferManagerComponentImpl::BufferBins is a table specifying N buffers of M size per bin. Up to MAX_NUM_BINS bins can be specified. The table is copied when setup() is called, so it does not need to be retained after the call. The rules for specifying bins: For each bin (BufferBins.bins[n]), specify the size of the buffers (bufferSize) in the bin and how many buffers for that bin (numBuffers). The bins must be ordered based on an increasing bufferSize to allow BufferManager to search for available buffers. When receiving a request for a buffer, the component will search for the first buffer from the bins that are equal to or greater than the requested size, starting at the beginning of the table. Any unused bins should have numBuffers set to 0. A single bin can be specified if a single size is needed. Note: a pointer to the Fw::MemAllocator used in setup() is stored for later memory cleanup. The instance of the allocator must persist beyond calling the cleanup() function or the destructor of BufferManager if cleanup() is not called. If a project-specific manual memory allocator is not needed, Fw::MallocAllocator can be used to supply heap allocated memory. Example Setup of Svc.BufferManager Fw :: MallocAllocator allocator ; Svc :: BufferManagerComponentImpl my_buffer_manager ; ... { Svc :: BufferManager :: BufferBins my_bins ; memset ( &amp; my_bins , 0 , sizeof ( my_bins )); // All non-specified bins are zero my_bins . bins [ 0 ]. bufferSize = 1024 ; // Buffers in bin 0 are of size 1024 my_bins . bins [ 0 ]. numBuffers = 2 ; // Two buffers of size 1024 are available in bin 0 my_bins . bins [ 1 ]. bufferSize = 10240 ; // Buffers in bin 1 are of size 10240 my_bins . bins [ 1 ]. numBuffers = 1 ; // One buffers of size 10240 are available in bin 1 my_buffer_manager . setup ( 123 , 0 , allocator , my_bins ); } ... { my_buffer_manager . cleanup (); } Rules of Thumb for Bin Sizes Buffers bins should be tailored based on expected usage. If many small requests are expected, then set up a large number of smaller bins. If larger allocations are expected, set bins of that size. The above trivial example allows for a few small allocations and one large allocation. In this case, there is a risk that the large allocation is used for the small allocation use case and thus care should be taken to ensure that the smaller use cases have a sufficient number of buffers to prevent stealing of larger allocations. Separation of Fw::Buffer Allocation and Deallocation There is no requirement that the allocating component and the deallocating component are the same. Thus components may be chained together for multiple processing steps before deallocation. There are two requirements: Fw::Buffers must eventually be returned to the instance that allocated them Svc.StaticMemory cannot be used in chains involving asynchronous calls Inter-component connections typically use the same Fw.BufferSend port to pass the buffer along the chain. A sample chain is shown here using Svc.BufferManager as the allocation source. comp1.allocate -&gt; my_buffer_manager.bufferGetCallee comp1.sendToProcess -&gt; comp2.process comp2.sendToProcessMore -&gt; comp3.processMore comp3.deallocate -&gt; my_buffer_manager.bufferSendIn © 2020 California Institute of Technology.

Serialization method provides type safety (higher coupling), raw pointer requires manual checks (lower coupling). \"Care should be taken\" indicates optional safety, not mandatory constraint.\n\n**Evidence:**\n```\n\"An easy way to work with an Fw::Buffer is to use the serialization representation of the buffer.

The architecture shows clear separation between:\n\n1. **Memory allocation policy** (StaticMemory vs BufferManager)\n2. **Client usage patterns** (synchronous vs asynchronous)\n3. **Safety mechanisms** (assertions, size checks, validation)\n\nThe pattern enables dynamic allocation while maintaining determinism through:\n- Pre-allocated pools (no runtime malloc in critical paths)\n- Explicit failure handling (size=0 return)\n- Ownership tracking (manager ID, buffer ID validation)\n\nThis is a well-documented example of **constraint-based coupling** where the architecture enforces safety through compile-time configuration and runtime assertions rather than relying solely on developer discipline.\n\nYour task:\n1.

The information in this guide may not be complete and will evolve as the project continues. When unclear, follow reasonable conventions for the language at hand. Note: These guidelines are for submissions to the F´ framework. Projects using F´ should adapt them as needed. F´ and Flight Software F´ is a flight software framework. Flight software is embedded software intended to run on “flight systems” like satellites, spacecraft, instruments, and more. Reliability is one of the most important goals of flight software since these systems are often operating for long durations without the option to service failing software. As such, contributions should be easy to read and easy to review. Remember, complexity and optimization sometimes come at the cost of readability or maintainability and that can mean simpler solutions are more appropriate. C++ C++ in F´ is written primarily following the embedded C++ style with some notable deviations. In addition, F´ follows the JPL Coding Standards as adapted from C. C++ is written under the C++11 standard , however; some C++11 features are avoided to support some incomplete C++11 implementations. Code format is based on the clang-format Chromium style. There are also a number of “rules-of-thumb” that C++ implementors should know. Embedded C++ Usage F´ is written with a modified embedded C++ style. Please note, unit test implementations often disregard these requirements as they run off-platform in a development context. The core points of embedded C++ that F´ uses are: No exceptions, code must compile with -fno-exceptions No uses of templates nor the Standard Template Library No typeid or run-time type information F´ has a few rules that deviate from the embedded C++ standard. This is done to increase safety, increase readability, and enable modern C++ development. These deviations are: Use namespaces to reduce naming conflicts. Use std::numeric_limits for mix/max values. Template implementations of std::numeric_limits have been approved. Use static_cast , reinterpret_cast , and const_cast instead of dangerous C-style and dynamic_cast casting. Limited use of multiple inheritance and virtual base classes are permitted. See rules of thumb. JPL Coding Standards There are additional rules from the software’s heritage as NASA/JPL Flight Software (see Power of 10 Rules ) and the framework itself. The guidelines were adapted from C guidelines and are summarized below: No recursion; No GOTOs Loops must have a fixed-bound No dynamic memory allocation after initialization Use FW_ASSERT to validate function inputs and computation Restrict data to the smallest necessary scope Check function return values or explicit discard with (void) Avoid the preprocessor and especially complex uses of the preprocessor Prefer Fw and Os implementations. e.g. use FW_ASSERT and Os::Mutex over cassert and std::mutex Compile without warnings, errors, and static analysis failures (e.g. pass continuous integration) Do not use Os::Task::delay to synchronize between threads Explicit enumeration values should be specified for all values or none at all C++11 Usage F´ has been updated to support C++11. Some C++11 implementations are incomplete requiring some deviations from C++11. Thus, there are some things that developers should be aware of when using C++11 features: Many C++11 features use templates under the hood. Prefer Fw and Os implementations for these features. Use of std::atomic is known to not work in some cases. Use is avoided. ClangFormat F´ uses ClangFormat based on Chromium. A .clang-format file is supplied at the root of the repository. The fprime-tools command line utility (&gt;v3.1.1) provides a command wrapping around clang-format. This utility is the preferred way to do formatting because it handles the PRIVATE , PROTECTED , and STATIC access modifiers used to enable white-box unit testing in F’. See ` fprime-util format –help` for instructions. New submissions should attempt to format appropriately. Rules of Thumb This section will document rules of thumb when developing F´ C++. These augment the formal guidelines to help users develop code that fits well with the entirety of F´. Documentation Components need to be documented through an Software Description Documents (SDD) placed in a docs subfolder. This SDD should capture: Requirements Design Implementation and Usage Notes C++ documentation is generated using doxygen. Doxygen-style comments should be used to annotate functions and variables. C++ APIs and libraries must be documented to produces usable doxygen documentation. Components should be documented in a similar fashion but the SDD captures the primary documentation for components. Asserts, WARNING Events, and FATAL Events Software should operate correctly in the event of off-nominal behavior. Asserts and events can be used to handle and/or report these occurrences. Runtime asserts (i.e. FW_ASSERT ) are used to ensure software integrity and assumptions. These are used to ensure that arguments passed to functions are within bounds, return values make since, and other confidence checks. Runtime assertions should never be used to validate user inputs nor results of hardware interaction as these may cause errors outside software control. In these cases, an event should be emitted to report the error, and the software should appropriately continue execution even in the case of erroneous input. The severity of the event emitted should be determined by the following rules: WARNING_LO events reflect issues localized to this component where recovery is possible. WARNING_HI events reflect issues affecting the larger system where recovery is possible. FATAL events reflect issues where recovery is not possible. The system is typically restarted in this case. WARNING_HI and FATAL events must be documented in the SDD and approved as part of the submission review. Use of Multiple-Inheritance and Virtual Base Classes Many of F´ constructs are required to inherit from an autocoded class that then inherits from framework base classes. This can present a problem as this precludes inheritance from other structures. Thus limited multiple inheritance is permitted. Basic guidelines are presented here, however; the use of multiple-inheritance will likely be discussed during the submission review. Only use multiple-inheritance when absolutely required Avoid inheritance from more than one hand-coded class Avoid inheritance from hand-coded descendants of autocoded classes and parents (e.g. Fw::PortBase and Fw::PassiveComponentBase ) not. i.e avoid inheritance from other Components, Ports, or classes that do. Avoid multiple inheritance paths that derive from a common base class a.k.a the diamond problem Normal usage for multiple and virtual types of inheritance in F´ is to set up interfaces as is often done in Java. This consists of a virtual C++ base class defining only functions. An F´ class or component would then use multiple-inheritance to inherit those function definitions with the intent of implementing them. This can be used to bridge autocoded F´ functionality and C++ functionality. For example, a component can supply F´ port call functionality to supporting classes through this style of interface. Python Python code is much easier as it is provided by the black formatter. Python code must pass a black format check.

The information in this guide may not be complete and will evolve as the project continues. When unclear, follow reasonable conventions for the language at hand. Note: These guidelines are for submissions to the F´ framework. Projects using F´ should adapt them as needed. F´ and Flight Software F´ is a flight software framework. Flight software is embedded software intended to run on “flight systems” like satellites, spacecraft, instruments, and more. Reliability is one of the most important goals of flight software since these systems are often operating for long durations without the option to service failing software. As such, contributions should be easy to read and easy to review. Remember, complexity and optimization sometimes come at the cost of readability or maintainability and that can mean simpler solutions are more appropriate. C++ C++ in F´ is written primarily following the embedded C++ style with some notable deviations. In addition, F´ follows the JPL Coding Standards as adapted from C. C++ is written under the C++11 standard , however; some C++11 features are avoided to support some incomplete C++11 implementations. Code format is based on the clang-format Chromium style. There are also a number of “rules-of-thumb” that C++ implementors should know. Embedded C++ Usage F´ is written with a modified embedded C++ style. Please note, unit test implementations often disregard these requirements as they run off-platform in a development context. The core points of embedded C++ that F´ uses are: No exceptions, code must compile with -fno-exceptions No uses of templates nor the Standard Template Library No typeid or run-time type information F´ has a few rules that deviate from the embedded C++ standard. This is done to increase safety, increase readability, and enable modern C++ development. These deviations are: Use namespaces to reduce naming conflicts. Use std::numeric_limits for mix/max values. Template implementations of std::numeric_limits have been approved. Use static_cast , reinterpret_cast , and const_cast instead of dangerous C-style and dynamic_cast casting. Limited use of multiple inheritance and virtual base classes are permitted. See rules of thumb. JPL Coding Standards There are additional rules from the software’s heritage as NASA/JPL Flight Software (see Power of 10 Rules ) and the framework itself. The guidelines were adapted from C guidelines and are summarized below: No recursion; No GOTOs Loops must have a fixed-bound No dynamic memory allocation after initialization Use FW_ASSERT to validate function inputs and computation Restrict data to the smallest necessary scope Check function return values or explicit discard with (void) Avoid the preprocessor and especially complex uses of the preprocessor Prefer Fw and Os implementations. e.g. use FW_ASSERT and Os::Mutex over cassert and std::mutex Compile without warnings, errors, and static analysis failures (e.g. pass continuous integration) Do not use Os::Task::delay to synchronize between threads Explicit enumeration values should be specified for all values or none at all C++11 Usage F´ has been updated to support C++11. Some C++11 implementations are incomplete requiring some deviations from C++11. Thus, there are some things that developers should be aware of when using C++11 features: Many C++11 features use templates under the hood. Prefer Fw and Os implementations for these features. Use of std::atomic is known to not work in some cases. Use is avoided. ClangFormat F´ uses ClangFormat based on Chromium. A .clang-format file is supplied at the root of the repository. The fprime-tools command line utility (&gt;v3.1.1) provides a command wrapping around clang-format. This utility is the preferred way to do formatting because it handles the PRIVATE , PROTECTED , and STATIC access modifiers used to enable white-box unit testing in F’. See ` fprime-util format –help` for instructions. New submissions should attempt to format appropriately. Rules of Thumb This section will document rules of thumb when developing F´ C++. These augment the formal guidelines to help users develop code that fits well with the entirety of F´. Documentation Components need to be documented through an Software Description Documents (SDD) placed in a docs subfolder. This SDD should capture: Requirements Design Implementation and Usage Notes C++ documentation is generated using doxygen. Doxygen-style comments should be used to annotate functions and variables. C++ APIs and libraries must be documented to produces usable doxygen documentation. Components should be documented in a similar fashion but the SDD captures the primary documentation for components. Asserts, WARNING Events, and FATAL Events Software should operate correctly in the event of off-nominal behavior. Asserts and events can be used to handle and/or report these occurrences. Runtime asserts (i.e. FW_ASSERT ) are used to ensure software integrity and assumptions. These are used to ensure that arguments passed to functions are within bounds, return values make since, and other confidence checks. Runtime assertions should never be used to validate user inputs nor results of hardware interaction as these may cause errors outside software control. In these cases, an event should be emitted to report the error, and the software should appropriately continue execution even in the case of erroneous input. The severity of the event emitted should be determined by the following rules: WARNING_LO events reflect issues localized to this component where recovery is possible. WARNING_HI events reflect issues affecting the larger system where recovery is possible. FATAL events reflect issues where recovery is not possible. The system is typically restarted in this case. WARNING_HI and FATAL events must be documented in the SDD and approved as part of the submission review. Use of Multiple-Inheritance and Virtual Base Classes Many of F´ constructs are required to inherit from an autocoded class that then inherits from framework base classes. This can present a problem as this precludes inheritance from other structures. Thus limited multiple inheritance is permitted. Basic guidelines are presented here, however; the use of multiple-inheritance will likely be discussed during the submission review. Only use multiple-inheritance when absolutely required Avoid inheritance from more than one hand-coded class Avoid inheritance from hand-coded descendants of autocoded classes and parents (e.g. Fw::PortBase and Fw::PassiveComponentBase ) not. i.e avoid inheritance from other Components, Ports, or classes that do. Avoid multiple inheritance paths that derive from a common base class a.k.a the diamond problem Normal usage for multiple and virtual types of inheritance in F´ is to set up interfaces as is often done in Java. This consists of a virtual C++ base class defining only functions. An F´ class or component would then use multiple-inheritance to inherit those function definitions with the intent of implementing them. This can be used to bridge autocoded F´ functionality and C++ functionality. For example, a component can supply F´ port call functionality to supporting classes through this style of interface. Python Python code is much easier as it is provided by the black formatter. Python code must pass a black format check.

The information in this guide may not be complete and will evolve as the project continues. When unclear, follow reasonable conventions for the language at hand. Note: These guidelines are for submissions to the F´ framework. Projects using F´ should adapt them as needed. F´ and Flight Software F´ is a flight software framework. Flight software is embedded software intended to run on “flight systems” like satellites, spacecraft, instruments, and more. Reliability is one of the most important goals of flight software since these systems are often operating for long durations without the option to service failing software. As such, contributions should be easy to read and easy to review. Remember, complexity and optimization sometimes come at the cost of readability or maintainability and that can mean simpler solutions are more appropriate. C++ C++ in F´ is written primarily following the embedded C++ style with some notable deviations. In addition, F´ follows the JPL Coding Standards as adapted from C. C++ is written under the C++11 standard , however; some C++11 features are avoided to support some incomplete C++11 implementations. Code format is based on the clang-format Chromium style. There are also a number of “rules-of-thumb” that C++ implementors should know. Embedded C++ Usage F´ is written with a modified embedded C++ style. Please note, unit test implementations often disregard these requirements as they run off-platform in a development context. The core points of embedded C++ that F´ uses are: No exceptions, code must compile with -fno-exceptions No uses of templates nor the Standard Template Library No typeid or run-time type information F´ has a few rules that deviate from the embedded C++ standard. This is done to increase safety, increase readability, and enable modern C++ development. These deviations are: Use namespaces to reduce naming conflicts. Use std::numeric_limits for mix/max values. Template implementations of std::numeric_limits have been approved. Use static_cast , reinterpret_cast , and const_cast instead of dangerous C-style and dynamic_cast casting. Limited use of multiple inheritance and virtual base classes are permitted. See rules of thumb. JPL Coding Standards There are additional rules from the software’s heritage as NASA/JPL Flight Software (see Power of 10 Rules ) and the framework itself. The guidelines were adapted from C guidelines and are summarized below: No recursion; No GOTOs Loops must have a fixed-bound No dynamic memory allocation after initialization Use FW_ASSERT to validate function inputs and computation Restrict data to the smallest necessary scope Check function return values or explicit discard with (void) Avoid the preprocessor and especially complex uses of the preprocessor Prefer Fw and Os implementations. e.g. use FW_ASSERT and Os::Mutex over cassert and std::mutex Compile without warnings, errors, and static analysis failures (e.g. pass continuous integration) Do not use Os::Task::delay to synchronize between threads Explicit enumeration values should be specified for all values or none at all C++11 Usage F´ has been updated to support C++11. Some C++11 implementations are incomplete requiring some deviations from C++11. Thus, there are some things that developers should be aware of when using C++11 features: Many C++11 features use templates under the hood. Prefer Fw and Os implementations for these features. Use of std::atomic is known to not work in some cases. Use is avoided. ClangFormat F´ uses ClangFormat based on Chromium. A .clang-format file is supplied at the root of the repository. The fprime-tools command line utility (&gt;v3.1.1) provides a command wrapping around clang-format. This utility is the preferred way to do formatting because it handles the PRIVATE , PROTECTED , and STATIC access modifiers used to enable white-box unit testing in F’. See ` fprime-util format –help` for instructions. New submissions should attempt to format appropriately. Rules of Thumb This section will document rules of thumb when developing F´ C++. These augment the formal guidelines to help users develop code that fits well with the entirety of F´. Documentation Components need to be documented through an Software Description Documents (SDD) placed in a docs subfolder. This SDD should capture: Requirements Design Implementation and Usage Notes C++ documentation is generated using doxygen. Doxygen-style comments should be used to annotate functions and variables. C++ APIs and libraries must be documented to produces usable doxygen documentation. Components should be documented in a similar fashion but the SDD captures the primary documentation for components. Asserts, WARNING Events, and FATAL Events Software should operate correctly in the event of off-nominal behavior. Asserts and events can be used to handle and/or report these occurrences. Runtime asserts (i.e. FW_ASSERT ) are used to ensure software integrity and assumptions. These are used to ensure that arguments passed to functions are within bounds, return values make since, and other confidence checks. Runtime assertions should never be used to validate user inputs nor results of hardware interaction as these may cause errors outside software control. In these cases, an event should be emitted to report the error, and the software should appropriately continue execution even in the case of erroneous input. The severity of the event emitted should be determined by the following rules: WARNING_LO events reflect issues localized to this component where recovery is possible. WARNING_HI events reflect issues affecting the larger system where recovery is possible. FATAL events reflect issues where recovery is not possible. The system is typically restarted in this case. WARNING_HI and FATAL events must be documented in the SDD and approved as part of the submission review. Use of Multiple-Inheritance and Virtual Base Classes Many of F´ constructs are required to inherit from an autocoded class that then inherits from framework base classes. This can present a problem as this precludes inheritance from other structures. Thus limited multiple inheritance is permitted. Basic guidelines are presented here, however; the use of multiple-inheritance will likely be discussed during the submission review. Only use multiple-inheritance when absolutely required Avoid inheritance from more than one hand-coded class Avoid inheritance from hand-coded descendants of autocoded classes and parents (e.g. Fw::PortBase and Fw::PassiveComponentBase ) not. i.e avoid inheritance from other Components, Ports, or classes that do. Avoid multiple inheritance paths that derive from a common base class a.k.a the diamond problem Normal usage for multiple and virtual types of inheritance in F´ is to set up interfaces as is often done in Java. This consists of a virtual C++ base class defining only functions. An F´ class or component would then use multiple-inheritance to inherit those function definitions with the intent of implementing them. This can be used to bridge autocoded F´ functionality and C++ functionality. For example, a component can supply F´ port call functionality to supporting classes through this style of interface. Python Python code is much easier as it is provided by the black formatter. Python code must pass a black format check.

This guide seeks to walk the user through some of the caveats and delicacies of such systems. It includes Baremetal Systems The Joy of Passive Components Choosing an Execution Context Multi-Core and Multi-Device Systems Thread Virtualization Defining Custom Tasks How It Works Baremetal Systems A baremetal system is a system that does not run an Operating System to support the F´ software. Thus, the F´ software must provide for basic services such as filesystems, thread schedulers, etc, to run. Since F´ was originally run on systems that provide these services, a number of precautions must be taken when designing F´systems for baremetal platforms. The Joy of Passive Components First and foremost, baremetal F´ systems should avoid using Active Components at all costs because these components require quasi-asynchronous execution contexts in which to run. i.e. they need thread such that they can execute in “parallel” with each other. Note: If you must use Active Components you should thoroughly review the thread virtualization section of this document and associated technology. If your system can be entirely defined by Passive Components then implicitly every port invocation would be synchronous and the execution context would be entirely delegated to every component. A discussion of the source of that delegated execution context comes next. Choosing an Execution Context Since the OS is not around to execute F´, the implementer of the F´ project must choose an execution context for F´ to run on. That is, ensuring that some call invokes all of the Components that compose the F´ system. Otherwise, some components will not run. Typically, this is handled by composing an F´ baremetal system into components that are all driven by rate groups . Designing the system this way ensures that all execution is derived from one source: the rate group driver and thus reducing the problem to supplying an execution context to the rate group driver at a set rate. All calls needed will execute during a sweep through the rate groups and their derived rates. Note: Other options exist (see Thread Virtualization below). Although a full discussion of supplying execution context to the rate group driver is outside the scope of this documentation, this author wanted to provide a few tips. First, F´ execution should be primarily derived from the main program loop. i.e. embedded software typically looks like the following and the loop-forever execute(); action should trigger the rate group driver at a set interval. // Run once setup setup(); // Do this forever while (true) { execute(); } Now all that is required is to determine when this interval has elapsed. This can be done by spinning on a hardware clock signal, calculating elapsed time by the reading of clock registers, using timing library functions, the sleep() call, or by a timer-driven interrupt service routine (ISR). Note: ISRs are complex items and should be studied in detail before going this route. Notably, the ISR should not execute the rate group directly, but rather should set a flag or queue a start message and allow the while (true) {} spin in the main loop to detect this signal and start the rate groups. Multi-Core and Multi-Device Systems We have yet to see any issues running F´ on multi-core systems. Some users have been successful in scheduling high-priority components to designated cores. In general, these systems behave just fine. Note: Some portions of F´ use U32 types so synchronize between threads. In many systems this is a safe atomic operation, however; this is not guaranteed in all systems. A project should use care to ensure that its system will behave as expected. These usages are under review and will be corrected over time. When running F´ on multi-platform systems, users typically define a deployment for each platform in the system. These deployments are then linked over the platform’s inter-communication architecture. Should users want F´ execution across these deployments to look like a single F´ deployment, users are advised to adopt the hub pattern to invoke F´ port calls across multiple devices. Thread Virtualization Note: This is an experimental technology with respect to F´. Care to understand its implementation should be taken before using it in a production/flight context. Some systems, even baremetal systems, require the use of Active Components . Many of the Svc components are by design active components. It is impractical to assume that all projects can, at the moment of conception, discard all use of the framework provided Active Components . Thus F´ was augmented with the ability to virtualize threading, such that projects could use these components during development as they migrate to a fully passive-component system. To activate this feature see: Configuring F´ . Continue reading for all the fancy details of how this system is designed. TODO: put a link to the thread scheduler API documentation. Defining Custom Tasks When using the thread virtualization technology, care should be taken with custom tasks/threads. This design, as described below, is dependent on threads that “run once” and externalize the looping part of the thread. Therefore, custom tasks must wrap functions that obey the following implementation requirements: The function shall not loop The function shall never block execution The function shall perform “one slice” of the thread and then return Failure to comply with these requirements will cause the thread virtualization technology to fail, and the F´ application to lock up or otherwise behave erratically. How It Works At the core of Active Components is a thread, which typically requires an Os to provide a scheduler for it to run, and through this scheduler, it gets designated an execution context to run in. Thus threads can execute as if they fully own their execution context and the Os masks this behind the scenes. The purpose of the thread virtualization when enabled for an F´ project is to unroll these threads such that they can share a single execution context and the parallel behavior of the threads is “virtualized”. The technique is known as protothreading. We’ll explore this concept with relation to F´ below. Each F´ thread supporting an Active component can be roughly modeled by the code below. The thread loops until the system shuts down. For each iteration through the loop it blocks (pauses execution) until a message arrives. It then dispatches the message and returns to a blocked state waiting for the next message. Component1 :: run_thread() { while (!shutdown) { msg = block_get_message(); dispatch(msg); } } Here block_get_messages(); retrieves messages, blocking until one arrives. This loop could have easily been implemented using a less-efficient model by iterating continuously through the loop and checking if a message has arrived and dispatching if and only if a message is available. As can be seen below, the wait-by-blocking has been replaced by the busy wait of constantly iterating through the loop. void Component1 :: run_once() { if (message_count() &gt; 0) { msg = nonblock_get_message(); dispatch(msg); } return; } Component1 :: run_thread() { while (!shutdown) { comp1.run_once(); } } Here, we extracted the iteration into a run_once function for clarity. The blocking wait in the first function is replaced with a spin on an if-condition until a message is available, then the dispatch happens. It should be only a slight extrapolation that one could move all the component run_once functions into a single loop and call each in succession. As long as these calls return in a reasonable amount of time, and none of these calls block internally, then crude parallelism is achieved. while (!shutdown) { comp1.run_once(); comp2.run_once(); comp3.run_once(); ... } Here, as seen above, run_once does not block and so each component gets a slice of execution time before yielding to the next. Parallelism has been virtualized and the processor is shareable without writing a full-blown thread scheduler nor requiring processor instruction set support to switch threading contexts. Inside F´ a parallel implementation of the active component task was implemented such that it returns rather than blocks on receiving messages. When BAREMETAL_SCHEDULER is enabled in the F´ configuration, this alternate implementation is used. Under Os/Baremetal , an implementation of a sequential scheduler exists. This scheduler snoops on task registration and will call all thread executions in a loop driven from the main program loop similar to below. setup(); // Setup F´ while (true) { scheduler.run_once(); } © 2020 California Institute of Technology.

This guide seeks to walk the user through some of the caveats and delicacies of such systems. It includes Baremetal Systems The Joy of Passive Components Choosing an Execution Context Multi-Core and Multi-Device Systems Thread Virtualization Defining Custom Tasks How It Works Baremetal Systems A baremetal system is a system that does not run an Operating System to support the F´ software. Thus, the F´ software must provide for basic services such as filesystems, thread schedulers, etc, to run. Since F´ was originally run on systems that provide these services, a number of precautions must be taken when designing F´systems for baremetal platforms. The Joy of Passive Components First and foremost, baremetal F´ systems should avoid using Active Components at all costs because these components require quasi-asynchronous execution contexts in which to run. i.e. they need thread such that they can execute in “parallel” with each other. Note: If you must use Active Components you should thoroughly review the thread virtualization section of this document and associated technology. If your system can be entirely defined by Passive Components then implicitly every port invocation would be synchronous and the execution context would be entirely delegated to every component. A discussion of the source of that delegated execution context comes next. Choosing an Execution Context Since the OS is not around to execute F´, the implementer of the F´ project must choose an execution context for F´ to run on. That is, ensuring that some call invokes all of the Components that compose the F´ system. Otherwise, some components will not run. Typically, this is handled by composing an F´ baremetal system into components that are all driven by rate groups . Designing the system this way ensures that all execution is derived from one source: the rate group driver and thus reducing the problem to supplying an execution context to the rate group driver at a set rate. All calls needed will execute during a sweep through the rate groups and their derived rates. Note: Other options exist (see Thread Virtualization below). Although a full discussion of supplying execution context to the rate group driver is outside the scope of this documentation, this author wanted to provide a few tips. First, F´ execution should be primarily derived from the main program loop. i.e. embedded software typically looks like the following and the loop-forever execute(); action should trigger the rate group driver at a set interval. // Run once setup setup(); // Do this forever while (true) { execute(); } Now all that is required is to determine when this interval has elapsed. This can be done by spinning on a hardware clock signal, calculating elapsed time by the reading of clock registers, using timing library functions, the sleep() call, or by a timer-driven interrupt service routine (ISR). Note: ISRs are complex items and should be studied in detail before going this route. Notably, the ISR should not execute the rate group directly, but rather should set a flag or queue a start message and allow the while (true) {} spin in the main loop to detect this signal and start the rate groups. Multi-Core and Multi-Device Systems We have yet to see any issues running F´ on multi-core systems. Some users have been successful in scheduling high-priority components to designated cores. In general, these systems behave just fine. Note: Some portions of F´ use U32 types so synchronize between threads. In many systems this is a safe atomic operation, however; this is not guaranteed in all systems. A project should use care to ensure that its system will behave as expected. These usages are under review and will be corrected over time. When running F´ on multi-platform systems, users typically define a deployment for each platform in the system. These deployments are then linked over the platform’s inter-communication architecture. Should users want F´ execution across these deployments to look like a single F´ deployment, users are advised to adopt the hub pattern to invoke F´ port calls across multiple devices. Thread Virtualization Note: This is an experimental technology with respect to F´. Care to understand its implementation should be taken before using it in a production/flight context. Some systems, even baremetal systems, require the use of Active Components . Many of the Svc components are by design active components. It is impractical to assume that all projects can, at the moment of conception, discard all use of the framework provided Active Components . Thus F´ was augmented with the ability to virtualize threading, such that projects could use these components during development as they migrate to a fully passive-component system. To activate this feature see: Configuring F´ . Continue reading for all the fancy details of how this system is designed. TODO: put a link to the thread scheduler API documentation. Defining Custom Tasks When using the thread virtualization technology, care should be taken with custom tasks/threads. This design, as described below, is dependent on threads that “run once” and externalize the looping part of the thread. Therefore, custom tasks must wrap functions that obey the following implementation requirements: The function shall not loop The function shall never block execution The function shall perform “one slice” of the thread and then return Failure to comply with these requirements will cause the thread virtualization technology to fail, and the F´ application to lock up or otherwise behave erratically. How It Works At the core of Active Components is a thread, which typically requires an Os to provide a scheduler for it to run, and through this scheduler, it gets designated an execution context to run in. Thus threads can execute as if they fully own their execution context and the Os masks this behind the scenes. The purpose of the thread virtualization when enabled for an F´ project is to unroll these threads such that they can share a single execution context and the parallel behavior of the threads is “virtualized”. The technique is known as protothreading. We’ll explore this concept with relation to F´ below. Each F´ thread supporting an Active component can be roughly modeled by the code below. The thread loops until the system shuts down. For each iteration through the loop it blocks (pauses execution) until a message arrives. It then dispatches the message and returns to a blocked state waiting for the next message. Component1 :: run_thread() { while (!shutdown) { msg = block_get_message(); dispatch(msg); } } Here block_get_messages(); retrieves messages, blocking until one arrives. This loop could have easily been implemented using a less-efficient model by iterating continuously through the loop and checking if a message has arrived and dispatching if and only if a message is available. As can be seen below, the wait-by-blocking has been replaced by the busy wait of constantly iterating through the loop. void Component1 :: run_once() { if (message_count() &gt; 0) { msg = nonblock_get_message(); dispatch(msg); } return; } Component1 :: run_thread() { while (!shutdown) { comp1.run_once(); } } Here, we extracted the iteration into a run_once function for clarity. The blocking wait in the first function is replaced with a spin on an if-condition until a message is available, then the dispatch happens. It should be only a slight extrapolation that one could move all the component run_once functions into a single loop and call each in succession. As long as these calls return in a reasonable amount of time, and none of these calls block internally, then crude parallelism is achieved. while (!shutdown) { comp1.run_once(); comp2.run_once(); comp3.run_once(); ... } Here, as seen above, run_once does not block and so each component gets a slice of execution time before yielding to the next. Parallelism has been virtualized and the processor is shareable without writing a full-blown thread scheduler nor requiring processor instruction set support to switch threading contexts. Inside F´ a parallel implementation of the active component task was implemented such that it returns rather than blocks on receiving messages. When BAREMETAL_SCHEDULER is enabled in the F´ configuration, this alternate implementation is used. Under Os/Baremetal , an implementation of a sequential scheduler exists. This scheduler snoops on task registration and will call all thread executions in a loop driven from the main program loop similar to below. setup(); // Setup F´ while (true) { scheduler.run_once(); } © 2020 California Institute of Technology.

Indirect coupling through flag/queue. Maintenance mechanism clear. Strength 0.70 due to \"should\" rather than \"must\".\n\n---\n\n### 6. Thread Virtualization → Active Component Support\n\n**candidate_type:** dependency\n\n**candidate_key:** thread_virtualization_enables_active_components\n\n**candidate_payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"from_entity\": \"Thread Virtualization (BAREMETAL_SCHEDULER)\",\n  \"to_entity\": \"Active Components on Baremetal\",\n  \"layer\": \"digital\",\n  \"coupling_strength\": 0.85,\n  \"what_flows\": \"virtualized parallel execution context\",\n  \"if_stops\": \"Active components cannot run on baremetal, must use only passive components\",\n  \"what_maintains\": \"Protothreading implementation, Os/Baremetal scheduler, run_once() pattern\",\n  \"constraints\": [\"experimental technology\", \"requires BAREMETAL_SCHEDULER config\", \"functions must not loop/block\"]\n}\n```\n\n**raw_evidence:** \"Thus F´ was augmented with the ability to virtualize threading, such that projects could use these components during development as they migrate to a fully passive-component system.\"\n\n**evidence_type:** explicit_statement\n\n**confidence_score:** 0.85\n\n**confidence_reasoning:** All 4 FRAMES questions answered.

The function shall never block execution. The function shall perform 'one slice' of the thread and then return. Failure to comply with these requirements will cause the thread virtualization technology to fail, and the F´ application to lock up or otherwise behave erratically.\"\n\n**evidence_type:** explicit_statement\n\n**confidence_score:** 0.98\n\n**confidence_reasoning:** All 4 FRAMES questions answered with exceptional clarity. Hard constraints (\"shall not\", \"shall never\", \"shall perform\"). Explicit failure mode (lock up, erratic behavior).

Hard constraint (\"must not block\"). Failure mode clear (parallelism breaks, starvation). Mechanism documented (nonblock_get_message).

These deployments are then linked over the platform's inter-communication architecture. Should users want F´ execution across these deployments to look like a single F´ deployment, users are advised to adopt the hub pattern to invoke F´ port calls across multiple devices.\"\n\n**evidence_type:** explicit_statement\n\n**confidence_score:** 0.65\n\n**confidence_reasoning:** 3 of 4 FRAMES questions answered. \"Advised\" indicates recommendation, not requirement.

Each of these views is customizable for the project to display exactly what they need to see and nothing else. Users are able to choose view components and modify them to suit project needs. Currently, there are 7 components to choose from: dashboard-box groups components together visually dashboard-row helps organize components horizontally command-input sends commands to the embedded system command-history displays previously-sent commands event-list displays events the GDS receives channel-table displays telemetry data from the spacecraft logging displays logged messages stored as the GDS runs Through an XML specification, users can set up their dashboard and upload it to the F´ GDS to enable it in the system. Once uploaded, the Dashboard should load the file and assemble the specified GUI as long as the XML is error-free. A more complete reference is available here: GDS Dashboard Reference . How to Use the Dashboard Setting Up XML Configuration Files Customizing Components An Example Dashboard Configuration Conclusion How to Use the Dashboard Start running the GDS GUI for your application by running fprime-gds in your deployment folder. Further instructions can be found here: GDS Introduction Navigate to the “Dashboard” tab using the navigation buttons at the top Click “Browse” and select an XML configuration file containing your dashboard setup The new Dashboard should render in the Dashboard tab. The browser will save your most recently-used Dashboard configuration and use it automatically when you restart the GUI. At any point, you can upload a new configuration file to change your Dashboard. Setting Up XML Configuration Files The dashboard is driven by loading an XML file that specifies the layout of this tab. In this, and the next few sections the XML format will be discussed. At its most basic, the XML format is HTML with a few extra custom F´ tags used to display our components. HTML may be used to help the user achieve the display they’d like, however; the entire display can be configured from our custom components and thus no HTML knowledge is required. Here are some basic rules on how the layout will be displayed: Components will stack top to bottom using 100% width, unless components are inside a dashboard-row Components inside a dashboard-row will instead layout horizontally left to right. If multiple components are inside a dashboard-row the elements will split the width. e.g. Four components each get 25% of the page width. dashboard-box and dashboard-row grow to contain all the components included and are limited to the maximum width Other components have a fixed height and variable width with scrollbars that appear when the component overflows Components will stay in the same row regardless of the page size and always maintain relative ordering The dashboard supports the following components shown below. Component Function Available F´ Fields ... Horizontal container for other components ... Box container for other components title Command builder and transmission component fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact List of commands sent as tracked by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Ordered list of events received by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Latest channel readings as received by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Customizing Components Individual components may be customized by passing in properties to them in the form of XML attributes. There are several general properties available to many components. Some components allow for other properties that are shown in the above table. Property Description Type Valid values title Title added as a label for box string any color Background color applied to box string Any CSS color border-color Color of border around the box string Any CSS color fields List of fields (columns) shown list any column field names filter-text Text to filter displayed items string any items-shown Names of items to restrict display list any compact Use minimalist display of component keyword Two of the most basic properties are described below. These were chosen because they show an example of using a string property and a space-separated list property. Keyword properties are specified without the =... portion and thus are not described. Title Property The title property is used to add a title to other components. This helps label the display such that it is easier to understand. The title property can be set by specifying the XML attribute as a string just as it is shown below. &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Giant Blob of Data\" &gt; ... Fields Property The fields property is used to restrict any of the table-driven components to minimize the number of columns that are shown. Thus, users can show just the columns of interest and ignore the others associated with the table owned by the component. This property is a list of space-separated values, and uses single quotes (‘) to contain values that included spaces. An example of both is shown below: &lt;channel-table fields= \"Description 'Channel Value' 'Channel Name'\" &gt; Each component type has different properties that can be used to customize it. All properties for components are completely optional and omitted properties will use a default value. These properties are described in full below. An Example Dashboard Configuration This section will provide an example dashboard configuration file. It shows how to compose various structures using the structural components as well as examples of using the existing F´ display components. The dashboard we will explore will be rendered into the following display. This view was rendered from the following XML. It is designed to be somewhat self-descriptive and should act as a good starting point for building your own dashboards. &lt;dashboard-box title= \"The Big Green Example Box\" color= \"green\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"This item is on top\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"But this item is below, by default\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Let's start a row instead\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box color= \"lightgreen\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"You can have boxes inside boxes...\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...and they'll start...\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...grouping by column again!\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Since that's the default\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"And boxes don't need colors\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box color= \"coral\" border-color= \"orangered\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Or titles.\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Clear Box\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Not-So-Clear Box\" color= \"aqua\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Box with a Border\" border-color= \"black\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A More Practical Example\" border-color= \"black\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Control Panel\" border-color= \"gainsboro\" &gt; &lt;command-input/&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Warnings\" color= \"lightyellow\" border-color= \"yellow\" &gt; &lt;event-list filter-text= \"WARNING\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Errors\" color= \"salmon\" border-color= \"red\" &gt; &lt;event-list filter-text= \"FATAL\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"You can pass in space-separated lists to do things\" border-color= \"black\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...like only showing certain columns\" &gt; &lt;event-list fields= \"'Event Name' 'Event Description'\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...or picking out specific channels\" &gt; &lt;channel-table items-shown= \"pingRcvr.PR_NumPings sendBuffComp.PacketsSent\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; Conclusion This guide has introduced and walked through an example of the XML dashboards available to help customize the F´ GDS GUI. Users may use the technology to build their own views into the system.

Currently, there are 7 components to choose from: dashboard-box groups components together visually dashboard-row helps organize components horizontally command-input sends commands to the embedded system command-history displays previously-sent commands event-list displays events the GDS receives channel-table displays telemetry data from the spacecraft logging displays logged messages stored as the GDS runs Through an XML specification, users can set up their dashboard and upload it to the F´ GDS to enable it in the system. Once uploaded, the Dashboard should load the file and assemble the specified GUI as long as the XML is error-free. A more complete reference is available here: GDS Dashboard Reference . How to Use the Dashboard Setting Up XML Configuration Files Customizing Components An Example Dashboard Configuration Conclusion How to Use the Dashboard Start running the GDS GUI for your application by running fprime-gds in your deployment folder. Further instructions can be found here: GDS Introduction Navigate to the “Dashboard” tab using the navigation buttons at the top Click “Browse” and select an XML configuration file containing your dashboard setup The new Dashboard should render in the Dashboard tab. The browser will save your most recently-used Dashboard configuration and use it automatically when you restart the GUI. At any point, you can upload a new configuration file to change your Dashboard. Setting Up XML Configuration Files The dashboard is driven by loading an XML file that specifies the layout of this tab. In this, and the next few sections the XML format will be discussed. At its most basic, the XML format is HTML with a few extra custom F´ tags used to display our components. HTML may be used to help the user achieve the display they’d like, however; the entire display can be configured from our custom components and thus no HTML knowledge is required. Here are some basic rules on how the layout will be displayed: Components will stack top to bottom using 100% width, unless components are inside a dashboard-row Components inside a dashboard-row will instead layout horizontally left to right. If multiple components are inside a dashboard-row the elements will split the width. e.g. Four components each get 25% of the page width. dashboard-box and dashboard-row grow to contain all the components included and are limited to the maximum width Other components have a fixed height and variable width with scrollbars that appear when the component overflows Components will stay in the same row regardless of the page size and always maintain relative ordering The dashboard supports the following components shown below. Component Function Available F´ Fields ... Horizontal container for other components ... Box container for other components title Command builder and transmission component fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact List of commands sent as tracked by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Ordered list of events received by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Latest channel readings as received by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Customizing Components Individual components may be customized by passing in properties to them in the form of XML attributes. There are several general properties available to many components. Some components allow for other properties that are shown in the above table. Property Description Type Valid values title Title added as a label for box string any color Background color applied to box string Any CSS color border-color Color of border around the box string Any CSS color fields List of fields (columns) shown list any column field names filter-text Text to filter displayed items string any items-shown Names of items to restrict display list any compact Use minimalist display of component keyword Two of the most basic properties are described below. These were chosen because they show an example of using a string property and a space-separated list property. Keyword properties are specified without the =... portion and thus are not described. Title Property The title property is used to add a title to other components. This helps label the display such that it is easier to understand. The title property can be set by specifying the XML attribute as a string just as it is shown below. &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Giant Blob of Data\" &gt; ... Fields Property The fields property is used to restrict any of the table-driven components to minimize the number of columns that are shown. Thus, users can show just the columns of interest and ignore the others associated with the table owned by the component. This property is a list of space-separated values, and uses single quotes (‘) to contain values that included spaces. An example of both is shown below: &lt;channel-table fields= \"Description 'Channel Value' 'Channel Name'\" &gt; Each component type has different properties that can be used to customize it. All properties for components are completely optional and omitted properties will use a default value. These properties are described in full below. An Example Dashboard Configuration This section will provide an example dashboard configuration file. It shows how to compose various structures using the structural components as well as examples of using the existing F´ display components. The dashboard we will explore will be rendered into the following display. This view was rendered from the following XML. It is designed to be somewhat self-descriptive and should act as a good starting point for building your own dashboards. &lt;dashboard-box title= \"The Big Green Example Box\" color= \"green\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"This item is on top\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"But this item is below, by default\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Let's start a row instead\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box color= \"lightgreen\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"You can have boxes inside boxes...\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...and they'll start...\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...grouping by column again!\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Since that's the default\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"And boxes don't need colors\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box color= \"coral\" border-color= \"orangered\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Or titles.\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Clear Box\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Not-So-Clear Box\" color= \"aqua\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Box with a Border\" border-color= \"black\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A More Practical Example\" border-color= \"black\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Control Panel\" border-color= \"gainsboro\" &gt; &lt;command-input/&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Warnings\" color= \"lightyellow\" border-color= \"yellow\" &gt; &lt;event-list filter-text= \"WARNING\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Errors\" color= \"salmon\" border-color= \"red\" &gt; &lt;event-list filter-text= \"FATAL\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"You can pass in space-separated lists to do things\" border-color= \"black\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...like only showing certain columns\" &gt; &lt;event-list fields= \"'Event Name' 'Event Description'\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...or picking out specific channels\" &gt; &lt;channel-table items-shown= \"pingRcvr.PR_NumPings sendBuffComp.PacketsSent\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; Conclusion This guide has introduced and walked through an example of the XML dashboards available to help customize the F´ GDS GUI. Users may use the technology to build their own views into the system.

Each of these views is customizable for the project to display exactly what they need to see and nothing else. Users are able to choose view components and modify them to suit project needs. Currently, there are 7 components to choose from: dashboard-box groups components together visually dashboard-row helps organize components horizontally command-input sends commands to the embedded system command-history displays previously-sent commands event-list displays events the GDS receives channel-table displays telemetry data from the spacecraft logging displays logged messages stored as the GDS runs Through an XML specification, users can set up their dashboard and upload it to the F´ GDS to enable it in the system. Once uploaded, the Dashboard should load the file and assemble the specified GUI as long as the XML is error-free. A more complete reference is available here: GDS Dashboard Reference . How to Use the Dashboard Setting Up XML Configuration Files Customizing Components An Example Dashboard Configuration Conclusion How to Use the Dashboard Start running the GDS GUI for your application by running fprime-gds in your deployment folder. Further instructions can be found here: GDS Introduction Navigate to the “Dashboard” tab using the navigation buttons at the top Click “Browse” and select an XML configuration file containing your dashboard setup The new Dashboard should render in the Dashboard tab. The browser will save your most recently-used Dashboard configuration and use it automatically when you restart the GUI. At any point, you can upload a new configuration file to change your Dashboard. Setting Up XML Configuration Files The dashboard is driven by loading an XML file that specifies the layout of this tab. In this, and the next few sections the XML format will be discussed. At its most basic, the XML format is HTML with a few extra custom F´ tags used to display our components. HTML may be used to help the user achieve the display they’d like, however; the entire display can be configured from our custom components and thus no HTML knowledge is required. Here are some basic rules on how the layout will be displayed: Components will stack top to bottom using 100% width, unless components are inside a dashboard-row Components inside a dashboard-row will instead layout horizontally left to right. If multiple components are inside a dashboard-row the elements will split the width. e.g. Four components each get 25% of the page width. dashboard-box and dashboard-row grow to contain all the components included and are limited to the maximum width Other components have a fixed height and variable width with scrollbars that appear when the component overflows Components will stay in the same row regardless of the page size and always maintain relative ordering The dashboard supports the following components shown below. Component Function Available F´ Fields ... Horizontal container for other components ... Box container for other components title Command builder and transmission component fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact List of commands sent as tracked by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Ordered list of events received by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Latest channel readings as received by the GDS fields, filter-text, items-shown, compact Customizing Components Individual components may be customized by passing in properties to them in the form of XML attributes. There are several general properties available to many components. Some components allow for other properties that are shown in the above table. Property Description Type Valid values title Title added as a label for box string any color Background color applied to box string Any CSS color border-color Color of border around the box string Any CSS color fields List of fields (columns) shown list any column field names filter-text Text to filter displayed items string any items-shown Names of items to restrict display list any compact Use minimalist display of component keyword Two of the most basic properties are described below. These were chosen because they show an example of using a string property and a space-separated list property. Keyword properties are specified without the =... portion and thus are not described. Title Property The title property is used to add a title to other components. This helps label the display such that it is easier to understand. The title property can be set by specifying the XML attribute as a string just as it is shown below. &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Giant Blob of Data\" &gt; ... Fields Property The fields property is used to restrict any of the table-driven components to minimize the number of columns that are shown. Thus, users can show just the columns of interest and ignore the others associated with the table owned by the component. This property is a list of space-separated values, and uses single quotes (‘) to contain values that included spaces. An example of both is shown below: &lt;channel-table fields= \"Description 'Channel Value' 'Channel Name'\" &gt; Each component type has different properties that can be used to customize it. All properties for components are completely optional and omitted properties will use a default value. These properties are described in full below. An Example Dashboard Configuration This section will provide an example dashboard configuration file. It shows how to compose various structures using the structural components as well as examples of using the existing F´ display components. The dashboard we will explore will be rendered into the following display. This view was rendered from the following XML. It is designed to be somewhat self-descriptive and should act as a good starting point for building your own dashboards. &lt;dashboard-box title= \"The Big Green Example Box\" color= \"green\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"This item is on top\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"But this item is below, by default\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Let's start a row instead\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box color= \"lightgreen\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"You can have boxes inside boxes...\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...and they'll start...\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...grouping by column again!\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Since that's the default\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"And boxes don't need colors\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box color= \"coral\" border-color= \"orangered\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Or titles.\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Clear Box\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Not-So-Clear Box\" color= \"aqua\" /&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A Box with a Border\" border-color= \"black\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"A More Practical Example\" border-color= \"black\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Control Panel\" border-color= \"gainsboro\" &gt; &lt;command-input/&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Warnings\" color= \"lightyellow\" border-color= \"yellow\" &gt; &lt;event-list filter-text= \"WARNING\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"Errors\" color= \"salmon\" border-color= \"red\" &gt; &lt;event-list filter-text= \"FATAL\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"You can pass in space-separated lists to do things\" border-color= \"black\" &gt; &lt;dashboard-row&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...like only showing certain columns\" &gt; &lt;event-list fields= \"'Event Name' 'Event Description'\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;dashboard-box title= \"...or picking out specific channels\" &gt; &lt;channel-table items-shown= \"pingRcvr.PR_NumPings sendBuffComp.PacketsSent\" /&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; &lt;/dashboard-row&gt; &lt;/dashboard-box&gt; Conclusion This guide has introduced and walked through an example of the XML dashboards available to help customize the F´ GDS GUI. Users may use the technology to build their own views into the system.

The Pleiades - Yearling Fleet We are assuming that you have received a fully assembled PROVES Kit to get started. If you only have the indivudual components please refer to the the assembly guide to get things together or the individual checkout procedures for individual components. Prerequisites Before we crack into using our PROVES Kit it is important to learn, acquire, or install a few useful tools. Required Items In order to interact with the hardware, we will need to install some software that will give us the ability to view and change the code from a serial terminal, download the latest code from the the Github, and edit the code if we desire. Make sure all of these tools are installed on your computer using the links below before proceeding! A Serial Terminal Software We need some way to read the output of the satellite on a serial port and ideally a way to also type serial commands back during debugging.Any software that is capable of opening a serial port will do (even the built in terminal on Linux and MacOS will work!), but we recommend installing something like Tabby for a better user experience. Figure 1: An example Tabby Landing Page Learn more about Tabby here . A Code Editor If you're a Linux lunatic you could view and edit all of your code on the command line using Vim or something, but our recommendation for a good user experience is something like Visual Studio Code! Figure 2: An example VS Code Page Page Learn more about VS Code here . A Working Knowledge of CircuitPython It is highly recommended that you get a fundemental understanding of how CircuitPython works before working with the PROVES Kit. CircuitPython is the easiest way to interface with and run tests on the hardware. Check out the Adafruit CiruitPython here . Note that these recommendations are for Windows and MacOS users. We presume that if you’re joining us from Linux you probably have your own way of doing all of this. Recommended Items Github Desktop Another one where if you are a power user you probably don't need this, but GitHub Desktop puts a really nice GUI in front of the Git experience. We use this to pull and push all of the code and design files from the GitHub repos. Learn more about GitHub Desktop here . There are a few hardware tools that are helpful when working with the satellite as well. A micro USB cable is essential, to connect to the satellite and pull data from it. The multimeter is useful for measuring the voltages across various parts of the kit to verify functionality. An SDR (Software Defined Radio) is completely optional, but very useful for verifying that the radio is working and it is also cool to listen into the airwaves around you. Hardware: Multimeter Micro USB Cable SDR (Optional) Initial Checkouts Assuming that you have a fully assembled PROVES Kit in front of you, we will go through a quick tour of the major features of the kit! Function Check Currently there is no dedicated function check script. The best way to validate if all of satellite's subsystems are online is to use the built in state of health functionality in the pysquared.py class. To do this, take the following steps: Connect to the satellite via the micro usb cable. You should see a USB drive pop up if you're using the CircuitPython firmware. Open a serial connection using Tabby. Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C to interupt any currently running code and follow the instructions that pop up to enter the REPL Once you enter the REPL , a satellite object will be imported and called c to give access to the core satellite functionalities. What does this command do? This line of code instantiates the cubesat class within pysquared.py and names it an object c . This gives us access to all of the core functionalities of the the satellite within a single object. We borrowed this design pattern from Max Holliday's PyCubed software implementation, so alot of the functionalities cross over. Call the c.hardware dictionary to determine if all of the satellite functionalities are true . Radio Check With an active instance of the cubesat class we can quickly send some packets to validate that the radio is operational. Make sure to check the properties in the self.radio_cfg dictionary before proceeding: #Default Configuration self . radio_cfg = { 'id' : 0xfb , # The ID of the sender 'gs' : 0xfa , # The ID of the receiver 'freq' : 437.4 , # Transmit frequency 'sf' : 8 , # LoRa Spreading Factor 'bw' : 125 , # Transmit bandwidth 'cr' : 8 , # LoRa Coding Rate 'pwr' : 23 , # Transmit power 'st' : 80000 } First, configure something to listen in and monitor the radio waves: Using an SDR If you have a SDR hooked up, tune into to frequency that you're transmitting on and watch the waterfall. Using another HopeRF Radio Module If you have a second PROVES Kit, a Flight Controller Dev Board, or a standalone RFM98PW you can use that to monitor for transmissions as well. Make sure that the 'id' and 'gs' parameters on the receiving node are the opposite of what they are on the sending node. Once you're ready to start receiving you can setup a receiving loop with the following coding pattern: from pysquared import cubesat as c import time while True : time . sleep ( 1 ) print ( c . radio1 . receive ()) This code will print either none when there is no received message or a whatever message has come over the airwaves if there is a valid packet. It can either be implemented as its own script and called or you're a pro gamer you can type it line by line into the REPL . If you are using a stand alone RFM98PW with a dev board you'll have to go through setting up the pins and radio object for the specific microcontroller you're pairing it with. We recommend referring to the Adafruit RFM9x documentation for how to do that. This is the most basic pattern for receiving and demodulating messages. For more advanced (and useful) test patterns please refer to our dedicated page on RFM9x Radio Usage . You can now send a packet using a command such as: c.radio1.send(\"Hello World!\") Warning If your PROVES Kit is equipped with the RFM98PW (the 433 Mhz Band radio) use caution when calling c.radio1.send() directly, as it bypasses the c.is_licensed parameter that will usually stop you from violating FCC regulations unless you've verified you have a valid license to operate the radio. Check if the message comes through! Each call of c.radio1.send() should return True if the radio accepts the string and sends it out sucessfully. You should also see the following things on whatever receiving device you're using as well: Using an SDR You should see a blip on the SDR shortly after using the send command. What that blip looks like will be different, depending on which modulation you are using: LoRa Mode Example LoRa Messages FSK Mode Using another HopeRF Radio Module If you are receiving from a HopeRF module your serial terminal should look someting like this: Tip There is now also a niffty radio_test.py script that helps to automate this process! Find it here . Acquiring Face Data Unless you have already implemented a payload into the PROVES Kit, most of the data you'll be interested in is the data reported by the satellite's faces. In order to poll this: Connect either to your top cap FC board or the EPS Board running Circuit Python and enter the REPL . Set up the cubesat object. from pysquared import cubesat as c Import the functions library. import functions Instantiate a functions object and pass the c object to it. f = functions . functions ( c ) Call f.all_face_data() . You should expect an output like this: Example Face Data Output Conducting a Range Test One of the number one things that keeps us up at night with the satellite is whether or not we will actually hear back from it after sending it off on its journey in outer space. As a result, a fundemental test to do for every build is a verification of the performance of the radio at long range. We will have a seperate page forthcoming that goes into detail about the reasons and methedology behind this test, but we will quickly reference some of the key steps here: Position a sending and receiving node some distance away from each other. We recommend at least 1km of seperation and a clear line of sight between the two nodes. Use the radio_test.py function on both devices to send and receive pings! Find that script here Record the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values and see what your link margin is looking like. Changing the Code Inevitably you'll want to change the code out on one of your boards. By default we recommend the CircuitPython implementation be loaded on the boards for ground testing, but this should be swapped out for more resiliant code before flight. Flashing Firmware Changing out the firmware on the microcontrollers is how we can switch between using CircuitPython or C/C++ binaries for our flight software. Ocasionally the dev team will also push an update directly to firmware, but this usally only happens when we have a hardware update, want to use a newer compiler, or have discovered a critical bug. Connect to the board using USB Locate the RESET and BOOTSELECT buttons on the board in question: Flight Controller Board Internal FC Board Button Locations Battery Board Battery Board Button Locations While holding the BOOTSELECT button, tap the RESET button The board will now reboot into bootloader mode Once in bootloader mode you can drag and drop a new .uf2 file in as needed. The latest version of the CiruitPython firmware can be found in the dedicated repo for each board. As an exmaple, check out the flight controller board firmware here . Can't Reach the Buttons? If you're currently using binaries, and want to switch to CircuitPython or update the firmware, sorry but you'll have to disassemble to access the buttons for a swap. If you're currently using CircuitPython you're in luck! There are some REPL commands that can come to the rescue. Just type the following into a fresh terminal: import microcontroller microcontroller . on_next_reset ( microcontroller . RunMode . UF2 ) microcontroller . reset () Updating CircuitPython Software Updating the CircuitPythong software is remarkably easy and painless, which is part of why we love using it so much in the lab and in the classroom! Get the code you want to update from the GitHub or your local machine. Connect to the board you want to update via USB. You should see a removable drive pop up when it is plugged into your computer. Drag and drop the new code over top of the old code!

The Pleiades - Yearling Fleet We are assuming that you have received a fully assembled PROVES Kit to get started. If you only have the indivudual components please refer to the the assembly guide to get things together or the individual checkout procedures for individual components. Prerequisites Before we crack into using our PROVES Kit it is important to learn, acquire, or install a few useful tools. Required Items In order to interact with the hardware, we will need to install some software that will give us the ability to view and change the code from a serial terminal, download the latest code from the the Github, and edit the code if we desire. Make sure all of these tools are installed on your computer using the links below before proceeding! A Serial Terminal Software We need some way to read the output of the satellite on a serial port and ideally a way to also type serial commands back during debugging.Any software that is capable of opening a serial port will do (even the built in terminal on Linux and MacOS will work!), but we recommend installing something like Tabby for a better user experience. Figure 1: An example Tabby Landing Page Learn more about Tabby here . A Code Editor If you're a Linux lunatic you could view and edit all of your code on the command line using Vim or something, but our recommendation for a good user experience is something like Visual Studio Code! Figure 2: An example VS Code Page Page Learn more about VS Code here . A Working Knowledge of CircuitPython It is highly recommended that you get a fundemental understanding of how CircuitPython works before working with the PROVES Kit. CircuitPython is the easiest way to interface with and run tests on the hardware. Check out the Adafruit CiruitPython here . Note that these recommendations are for Windows and MacOS users. We presume that if you’re joining us from Linux you probably have your own way of doing all of this. Recommended Items Github Desktop Another one where if you are a power user you probably don't need this, but GitHub Desktop puts a really nice GUI in front of the Git experience. We use this to pull and push all of the code and design files from the GitHub repos. Learn more about GitHub Desktop here . There are a few hardware tools that are helpful when working with the satellite as well. A micro USB cable is essential, to connect to the satellite and pull data from it. The multimeter is useful for measuring the voltages across various parts of the kit to verify functionality. An SDR (Software Defined Radio) is completely optional, but very useful for verifying that the radio is working and it is also cool to listen into the airwaves around you. Hardware: Multimeter Micro USB Cable SDR (Optional) Initial Checkouts Assuming that you have a fully assembled PROVES Kit in front of you, we will go through a quick tour of the major features of the kit! Function Check Currently there is no dedicated function check script. The best way to validate if all of satellite's subsystems are online is to use the built in state of health functionality in the pysquared.py class. To do this, take the following steps: Connect to the satellite via the micro usb cable. You should see a USB drive pop up if you're using the CircuitPython firmware. Open a serial connection using Tabby. Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C to interupt any currently running code and follow the instructions that pop up to enter the REPL Once you enter the REPL , a satellite object will be imported and called c to give access to the core satellite functionalities. What does this command do? This line of code instantiates the cubesat class within pysquared.py and names it an object c . This gives us access to all of the core functionalities of the the satellite within a single object. We borrowed this design pattern from Max Holliday's PyCubed software implementation, so alot of the functionalities cross over. Call the c.hardware dictionary to determine if all of the satellite functionalities are true . Radio Check With an active instance of the cubesat class we can quickly send some packets to validate that the radio is operational. Make sure to check the properties in the self.radio_cfg dictionary before proceeding: #Default Configuration self . radio_cfg = { 'id' : 0xfb , # The ID of the sender 'gs' : 0xfa , # The ID of the receiver 'freq' : 437.4 , # Transmit frequency 'sf' : 8 , # LoRa Spreading Factor 'bw' : 125 , # Transmit bandwidth 'cr' : 8 , # LoRa Coding Rate 'pwr' : 23 , # Transmit power 'st' : 80000 } First, configure something to listen in and monitor the radio waves: Using an SDR If you have a SDR hooked up, tune into to frequency that you're transmitting on and watch the waterfall. Using another HopeRF Radio Module If you have a second PROVES Kit, a Flight Controller Dev Board, or a standalone RFM98PW you can use that to monitor for transmissions as well. Make sure that the 'id' and 'gs' parameters on the receiving node are the opposite of what they are on the sending node. Once you're ready to start receiving you can setup a receiving loop with the following coding pattern: from pysquared import cubesat as c import time while True : time . sleep ( 1 ) print ( c . radio1 . receive ()) This code will print either none when there is no received message or a whatever message has come over the airwaves if there is a valid packet. It can either be implemented as its own script and called or you're a pro gamer you can type it line by line into the REPL . If you are using a stand alone RFM98PW with a dev board you'll have to go through setting up the pins and radio object for the specific microcontroller you're pairing it with. We recommend referring to the Adafruit RFM9x documentation for how to do that. This is the most basic pattern for receiving and demodulating messages. For more advanced (and useful) test patterns please refer to our dedicated page on RFM9x Radio Usage . You can now send a packet using a command such as: c.radio1.send(\"Hello World!\") Warning If your PROVES Kit is equipped with the RFM98PW (the 433 Mhz Band radio) use caution when calling c.radio1.send() directly, as it bypasses the c.is_licensed parameter that will usually stop you from violating FCC regulations unless you've verified you have a valid license to operate the radio. Check if the message comes through! Each call of c.radio1.send() should return True if the radio accepts the string and sends it out sucessfully. You should also see the following things on whatever receiving device you're using as well: Using an SDR You should see a blip on the SDR shortly after using the send command. What that blip looks like will be different, depending on which modulation you are using: LoRa Mode Example LoRa Messages FSK Mode Using another HopeRF Radio Module If you are receiving from a HopeRF module your serial terminal should look someting like this: Tip There is now also a niffty radio_test.py script that helps to automate this process! Find it here . Acquiring Face Data Unless you have already implemented a payload into the PROVES Kit, most of the data you'll be interested in is the data reported by the satellite's faces. In order to poll this: Connect either to your top cap FC board or the EPS Board running Circuit Python and enter the REPL . Set up the cubesat object. from pysquared import cubesat as c Import the functions library. import functions Instantiate a functions object and pass the c object to it. f = functions . functions ( c ) Call f.all_face_data() . You should expect an output like this: Example Face Data Output Conducting a Range Test One of the number one things that keeps us up at night with the satellite is whether or not we will actually hear back from it after sending it off on its journey in outer space. As a result, a fundemental test to do for every build is a verification of the performance of the radio at long range. We will have a seperate page forthcoming that goes into detail about the reasons and methedology behind this test, but we will quickly reference some of the key steps here: Position a sending and receiving node some distance away from each other. We recommend at least 1km of seperation and a clear line of sight between the two nodes. Use the radio_test.py function on both devices to send and receive pings! Find that script here Record the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values and see what your link margin is looking like. Changing the Code Inevitably you'll want to change the code out on one of your boards. By default we recommend the CircuitPython implementation be loaded on the boards for ground testing, but this should be swapped out for more resiliant code before flight. Flashing Firmware Changing out the firmware on the microcontrollers is how we can switch between using CircuitPython or C/C++ binaries for our flight software. Ocasionally the dev team will also push an update directly to firmware, but this usally only happens when we have a hardware update, want to use a newer compiler, or have discovered a critical bug. Connect to the board using USB Locate the RESET and BOOTSELECT buttons on the board in question: Flight Controller Board Internal FC Board Button Locations Battery Board Battery Board Button Locations While holding the BOOTSELECT button, tap the RESET button The board will now reboot into bootloader mode Once in bootloader mode you can drag and drop a new .uf2 file in as needed. The latest version of the CiruitPython firmware can be found in the dedicated repo for each board. As an exmaple, check out the flight controller board firmware here . Can't Reach the Buttons? If you're currently using binaries, and want to switch to CircuitPython or update the firmware, sorry but you'll have to disassemble to access the buttons for a swap. If you're currently using CircuitPython you're in luck! There are some REPL commands that can come to the rescue. Just type the following into a fresh terminal: import microcontroller microcontroller . on_next_reset ( microcontroller . RunMode . UF2 ) microcontroller . reset () Updating CircuitPython Software Updating the CircuitPythong software is remarkably easy and painless, which is part of why we love using it so much in the lab and in the classroom! Get the code you want to update from the GitHub or your local machine. Connect to the board you want to update via USB. You should see a removable drive pop up when it is plugged into your computer.

The Pleiades - Yearling Fleet We are assuming that you have received a fully assembled PROVES Kit to get started. If you only have the indivudual components please refer to the the assembly guide to get things together or the individual checkout procedures for individual components. Prerequisites Before we crack into using our PROVES Kit it is important to learn, acquire, or install a few useful tools. Required Items In order to interact with the hardware, we will need to install some software that will give us the ability to view and change the code from a serial terminal, download the latest code from the the Github, and edit the code if we desire. Make sure all of these tools are installed on your computer using the links below before proceeding! A Serial Terminal Software We need some way to read the output of the satellite on a serial port and ideally a way to also type serial commands back during debugging.Any software that is capable of opening a serial port will do (even the built in terminal on Linux and MacOS will work!), but we recommend installing something like Tabby for a better user experience. Figure 1: An example Tabby Landing Page Learn more about Tabby here . A Code Editor If you're a Linux lunatic you could view and edit all of your code on the command line using Vim or something, but our recommendation for a good user experience is something like Visual Studio Code! Figure 2: An example VS Code Page Page Learn more about VS Code here . A Working Knowledge of CircuitPython It is highly recommended that you get a fundemental understanding of how CircuitPython works before working with the PROVES Kit. CircuitPython is the easiest way to interface with and run tests on the hardware. Check out the Adafruit CiruitPython here . Note that these recommendations are for Windows and MacOS users. We presume that if you’re joining us from Linux you probably have your own way of doing all of this. Recommended Items Github Desktop Another one where if you are a power user you probably don't need this, but GitHub Desktop puts a really nice GUI in front of the Git experience. We use this to pull and push all of the code and design files from the GitHub repos. Learn more about GitHub Desktop here . There are a few hardware tools that are helpful when working with the satellite as well. A micro USB cable is essential, to connect to the satellite and pull data from it. The multimeter is useful for measuring the voltages across various parts of the kit to verify functionality. An SDR (Software Defined Radio) is completely optional, but very useful for verifying that the radio is working and it is also cool to listen into the airwaves around you. Hardware: Multimeter Micro USB Cable SDR (Optional) Initial Checkouts Assuming that you have a fully assembled PROVES Kit in front of you, we will go through a quick tour of the major features of the kit! Function Check Currently there is no dedicated function check script. The best way to validate if all of satellite's subsystems are online is to use the built in state of health functionality in the pysquared.py class. To do this, take the following steps: Connect to the satellite via the micro usb cable. You should see a USB drive pop up if you're using the CircuitPython firmware. Open a serial connection using Tabby. Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C to interupt any currently running code and follow the instructions that pop up to enter the REPL Once you enter the REPL , a satellite object will be imported and called c to give access to the core satellite functionalities. What does this command do? This line of code instantiates the cubesat class within pysquared.py and names it an object c . This gives us access to all of the core functionalities of the the satellite within a single object. We borrowed this design pattern from Max Holliday's PyCubed software implementation, so alot of the functionalities cross over. Call the c.hardware dictionary to determine if all of the satellite functionalities are true . Radio Check With an active instance of the cubesat class we can quickly send some packets to validate that the radio is operational. Make sure to check the properties in the self.radio_cfg dictionary before proceeding: #Default Configuration self . radio_cfg = { 'id' : 0xfb , # The ID of the sender 'gs' : 0xfa , # The ID of the receiver 'freq' : 437.4 , # Transmit frequency 'sf' : 8 , # LoRa Spreading Factor 'bw' : 125 , # Transmit bandwidth 'cr' : 8 , # LoRa Coding Rate 'pwr' : 23 , # Transmit power 'st' : 80000 } First, configure something to listen in and monitor the radio waves: Using an SDR If you have a SDR hooked up, tune into to frequency that you're transmitting on and watch the waterfall. Using another HopeRF Radio Module If you have a second PROVES Kit, a Flight Controller Dev Board, or a standalone RFM98PW you can use that to monitor for transmissions as well. Make sure that the 'id' and 'gs' parameters on the receiving node are the opposite of what they are on the sending node. Once you're ready to start receiving you can setup a receiving loop with the following coding pattern: from pysquared import cubesat as c import time while True : time . sleep ( 1 ) print ( c . radio1 . receive ()) This code will print either none when there is no received message or a whatever message has come over the airwaves if there is a valid packet. It can either be implemented as its own script and called or you're a pro gamer you can type it line by line into the REPL . If you are using a stand alone RFM98PW with a dev board you'll have to go through setting up the pins and radio object for the specific microcontroller you're pairing it with. We recommend referring to the Adafruit RFM9x documentation for how to do that. This is the most basic pattern for receiving and demodulating messages. For more advanced (and useful) test patterns please refer to our dedicated page on RFM9x Radio Usage . You can now send a packet using a command such as: c.radio1.send(\"Hello World!\") Warning If your PROVES Kit is equipped with the RFM98PW (the 433 Mhz Band radio) use caution when calling c.radio1.send() directly, as it bypasses the c.is_licensed parameter that will usually stop you from violating FCC regulations unless you've verified you have a valid license to operate the radio. Check if the message comes through! Each call of c.radio1.send() should return True if the radio accepts the string and sends it out sucessfully. You should also see the following things on whatever receiving device you're using as well: Using an SDR You should see a blip on the SDR shortly after using the send command. What that blip looks like will be different, depending on which modulation you are using: LoRa Mode Example LoRa Messages FSK Mode Using another HopeRF Radio Module If you are receiving from a HopeRF module your serial terminal should look someting like this: Tip There is now also a niffty radio_test.py script that helps to automate this process! Find it here . Acquiring Face Data Unless you have already implemented a payload into the PROVES Kit, most of the data you'll be interested in is the data reported by the satellite's faces. In order to poll this: Connect either to your top cap FC board or the EPS Board running Circuit Python and enter the REPL . Set up the cubesat object. from pysquared import cubesat as c Import the functions library. import functions Instantiate a functions object and pass the c object to it. f = functions . functions ( c ) Call f.all_face_data() . You should expect an output like this: Example Face Data Output Conducting a Range Test One of the number one things that keeps us up at night with the satellite is whether or not we will actually hear back from it after sending it off on its journey in outer space. As a result, a fundemental test to do for every build is a verification of the performance of the radio at long range. We will have a seperate page forthcoming that goes into detail about the reasons and methedology behind this test, but we will quickly reference some of the key steps here: Position a sending and receiving node some distance away from each other. We recommend at least 1km of seperation and a clear line of sight between the two nodes. Use the radio_test.py function on both devices to send and receive pings! Find that script here Record the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values and see what your link margin is looking like. Changing the Code Inevitably you'll want to change the code out on one of your boards. By default we recommend the CircuitPython implementation be loaded on the boards for ground testing, but this should be swapped out for more resiliant code before flight. Flashing Firmware Changing out the firmware on the microcontrollers is how we can switch between using CircuitPython or C/C++ binaries for our flight software. Ocasionally the dev team will also push an update directly to firmware, but this usally only happens when we have a hardware update, want to use a newer compiler, or have discovered a critical bug. Connect to the board using USB Locate the RESET and BOOTSELECT buttons on the board in question: Flight Controller Board Internal FC Board Button Locations Battery Board Battery Board Button Locations While holding the BOOTSELECT button, tap the RESET button The board will now reboot into bootloader mode Once in bootloader mode you can drag and drop a new .uf2 file in as needed. The latest version of the CiruitPython firmware can be found in the dedicated repo for each board. As an exmaple, check out the flight controller board firmware here . Can't Reach the Buttons? If you're currently using binaries, and want to switch to CircuitPython or update the firmware, sorry but you'll have to disassemble to access the buttons for a swap. If you're currently using CircuitPython you're in luck! There are some REPL commands that can come to the rescue. Just type the following into a fresh terminal: import microcontroller microcontroller . on_next_reset ( microcontroller . RunMode . UF2 ) microcontroller . reset () Updating CircuitPython Software Updating the CircuitPythong software is remarkably easy and painless, which is part of why we love using it so much in the lab and in the classroom! Get the code you want to update from the GitHub or your local machine. Connect to the board you want to update via USB. You should see a removable drive pop up when it is plugged into your computer. Drag and drop the new code over top of the old code!

These steps assume that previous tests have been successful and that the antennas have been soldered to the Flight Computer. If these steps are not completed, please complete them before proceeding: Insert Batteries Insert all the batteries into the battery board starting on the right and moving to the left. Jump J18 on Battery Board Jump J18 on the battery board to bypass the need for inserting all the switches. Alternatively, insert the switches if they are to be included in the test (do not jump J18 in this case). Confirm 3.3V Regulation Probe the 3.3V test point and confirm that the board is regulating the 3.3V bus. Connect Battery Board to Flight Computer Plug the 12 position Molex Pico-Lock into the board and the other end into the Flight Computer Board. The Blue LED on the bottom of the Flight Computer should illuminate. Connect Solar Boards Plug in all the 5 position Molex Pico-Lock connectors into the battery board. Then plug the other ends into the solar boards. Ensure the correct connection of the connectors to the respective faces. Connect to a Desktop Connect the Flight computer to a desktop using a Micro USB cable. The filesystem should appear. Load Testing File Load the “FlatSatTest.py” file into the directory “PYSQUARED”. Open a Terminal Open a terminal for the COM port connected to the satellite. Run Test Command Type the command: import flatsattest . Observe Results Check for the expected set of results. Troubleshooting If results are not successful, follow these steps: a. LED Driver issues: If initializing the LED Driver fails, check the I2C address at 0x56. b.

F´ defines both useful short names for primitive types as well as a set of autocoded complex types. The types describe here are available to both the flight software and the ground system unless otherwise noted. Included in this document: Primitive Types Polymorphic Type Complex Types Enums Arrays Serializables C++ Classes Conclusion Primitive Types F´ provides convenient type names for C/C++ primitive types. These are established to simplify the writing of F´ code across multiple systems as well as give an exact definition for each variable used. These types are described in the following table and are available to both the ground system, events, channels, and commands, and the software itself. F´ Type C/C++ Type Description BOOL bool C++ boolean I8 int8_t signed 8-bit integer I16 int16_t signed 16-bit integer I32 int32_t signed 32-bit integer U8 uint8_t unsigned 8-bit integer U16 uint16_t unsigned 16-bit integer U32 uint32_t unsigned 32-bit integer F32 float 32-bit floating point F64 double 64-bit floating point NATIVE_INT_TYPE int architecture dependent integer NATIVE_UINT_TYPE unsigned int architecture dependent unsigned integer POINTER_CAST integer of sufficient size to store a pointer for the architecture Note: C/C++ types come from stdint.h and stdbool.h . The last three types above are not of set size but are architecture-dependent. Should a project’s architecture not support all these types, see: Configuring F´: Architecture Supported Primitive Types Polymorphic Type F´ defines a type for use by the user that can represent any of the primitive types using the same storage space. This is similar to a C union defined with fields of each above type. Setting Polymorphic Values The PolyType object can have a value assigned to it via the constructor or the equals operator: PolyType myInt(123) PolyType myFloat; myFloat = 123.03 Getting Polymorphic Values The value stored in the PolyType object can be retrieved in two ways: 1) Cast the object to the type of the value: U32 val = (U32)pt; 6) Use the get() method: U32 val; pt.get(val); In both cases, if the type being retrieved does not match the stored type, the code will assert. Checking Polymorphic Values The PolyType instance has isXXX functions for checking what type is being stored, where XXX is the name of the type. PolyType p(123); if (p.isU32()) { ... } Complex Types The F´ framework supports several types of auto-generated complex types that can be used in the system, including use in software, command, event, and channel types, and even with the F´ ground system. These types are: Enums: defined enumeration of values Arrays: fixed-length containers of other types Serializable: defined composition of other types akin to a C++ struct / class These can all be designed and used in the modeling of F´ and the C++ implementation is autogenerated. Enums Enums are a fixed set of values that can be referred to by name, but are stored and transmitted as an integer type. The auto-generator produces a class to wrap the type providing convenience functions. Arrays Arrays are fixed-length containers of other types. They must be type-homogeneous but can store any other single type. Serializables Serializables are field-value compositions of other types. They can be type-heterogeneous and may contain any other type as a value. The autocoder will generate a class with accessor methods for the fields. See the full specification for the serializable XML: F´ XML Specifications: Serializables C++ Classes When interacting only in the software and not within the F´ design layer, nor with the ground system the user may use arbitrary C++ class / struct types. If these types are to be passed through a port invocation as an argument, they should be defined as subclasses of the Fw::Serializable and define serialize and deserialize methods to be called to perform the serialization. Conclusion F´ supports many different types, including autocoded complex types. © 2020 California Institute of Technology. Government sponsorship acknowledged.

F´ defines both useful short names for primitive types as well as a set of autocoded complex types. The types describe here are available to both the flight software and the ground system unless otherwise noted. Included in this document: Primitive Types Polymorphic Type Complex Types Enums Arrays Serializables C++ Classes Conclusion Primitive Types F´ provides convenient type names for C/C++ primitive types. These are established to simplify the writing of F´ code across multiple systems as well as give an exact definition for each variable used. These types are described in the following table and are available to both the ground system, events, channels, and commands, and the software itself. F´ Type C/C++ Type Description BOOL bool C++ boolean I8 int8_t signed 8-bit integer I16 int16_t signed 16-bit integer I32 int32_t signed 32-bit integer U8 uint8_t unsigned 8-bit integer U16 uint16_t unsigned 16-bit integer U32 uint32_t unsigned 32-bit integer F32 float 32-bit floating point F64 double 64-bit floating point NATIVE_INT_TYPE int architecture dependent integer NATIVE_UINT_TYPE unsigned int architecture dependent unsigned integer POINTER_CAST integer of sufficient size to store a pointer for the architecture Note: C/C++ types come from stdint.h and stdbool.h . The last three types above are not of set size but are architecture-dependent. Should a project’s architecture not support all these types, see: Configuring F´: Architecture Supported Primitive Types Polymorphic Type F´ defines a type for use by the user that can represent any of the primitive types using the same storage space. This is similar to a C union defined with fields of each above type. Setting Polymorphic Values The PolyType object can have a value assigned to it via the constructor or the equals operator: PolyType myInt(123) PolyType myFloat; myFloat = 123.03 Getting Polymorphic Values The value stored in the PolyType object can be retrieved in two ways: 1) Cast the object to the type of the value: U32 val = (U32)pt; 6) Use the get() method: U32 val; pt.get(val); In both cases, if the type being retrieved does not match the stored type, the code will assert. Checking Polymorphic Values The PolyType instance has isXXX functions for checking what type is being stored, where XXX is the name of the type. PolyType p(123); if (p.isU32()) { ... } Complex Types The F´ framework supports several types of auto-generated complex types that can be used in the system, including use in software, command, event, and channel types, and even with the F´ ground system. These types are: Enums: defined enumeration of values Arrays: fixed-length containers of other types Serializable: defined composition of other types akin to a C++ struct / class These can all be designed and used in the modeling of F´ and the C++ implementation is autogenerated. Enums Enums are a fixed set of values that can be referred to by name, but are stored and transmitted as an integer type. The auto-generator produces a class to wrap the type providing convenience functions. Arrays Arrays are fixed-length containers of other types. They must be type-homogeneous but can store any other single type. Serializables Serializables are field-value compositions of other types. They can be type-heterogeneous and may contain any other type as a value. The autocoder will generate a class with accessor methods for the fields. See the full specification for the serializable XML: F´ XML Specifications: Serializables C++ Classes When interacting only in the software and not within the F´ design layer, nor with the ground system the user may use arbitrary C++ class / struct types. If these types are to be passed through a port invocation as an argument, they should be defined as subclasses of the Fw::Serializable and define serialize and deserialize methods to be called to perform the serialization. Conclusion F´ supports many different types, including autocoded complex types. © 2020 California Institute of Technology. Government sponsorship acknowledged.

F´ defines both useful short names for primitive types as well as a set of autocoded complex types. The types describe here are available to both the flight software and the ground system unless otherwise noted. Included in this document: Primitive Types Polymorphic Type Complex Types Enums Arrays Serializables C++ Classes Conclusion Primitive Types F´ provides convenient type names for C/C++ primitive types. These are established to simplify the writing of F´ code across multiple systems as well as give an exact definition for each variable used. These types are described in the following table and are available to both the ground system, events, channels, and commands, and the software itself. F´ Type C/C++ Type Description BOOL bool C++ boolean I8 int8_t signed 8-bit integer I16 int16_t signed 16-bit integer I32 int32_t signed 32-bit integer U8 uint8_t unsigned 8-bit integer U16 uint16_t unsigned 16-bit integer U32 uint32_t unsigned 32-bit integer F32 float 32-bit floating point F64 double 64-bit floating point NATIVE_INT_TYPE int architecture dependent integer NATIVE_UINT_TYPE unsigned int architecture dependent unsigned integer POINTER_CAST integer of sufficient size to store a pointer for the architecture Note: C/C++ types come from stdint.h and stdbool.h . The last three types above are not of set size but are architecture-dependent. Should a project’s architecture not support all these types, see: Configuring F´: Architecture Supported Primitive Types Polymorphic Type F´ defines a type for use by the user that can represent any of the primitive types using the same storage space. This is similar to a C union defined with fields of each above type. Setting Polymorphic Values The PolyType object can have a value assigned to it via the constructor or the equals operator: PolyType myInt(123) PolyType myFloat; myFloat = 123.03 Getting Polymorphic Values The value stored in the PolyType object can be retrieved in two ways: 1) Cast the object to the type of the value: U32 val = (U32)pt; 6) Use the get() method: U32 val; pt.get(val); In both cases, if the type being retrieved does not match the stored type, the code will assert. Checking Polymorphic Values The PolyType instance has isXXX functions for checking what type is being stored, where XXX is the name of the type. PolyType p(123); if (p.isU32()) { ... } Complex Types The F´ framework supports several types of auto-generated complex types that can be used in the system, including use in software, command, event, and channel types, and even with the F´ ground system. These types are: Enums: defined enumeration of values Arrays: fixed-length containers of other types Serializable: defined composition of other types akin to a C++ struct / class These can all be designed and used in the modeling of F´ and the C++ implementation is autogenerated. Enums Enums are a fixed set of values that can be referred to by name, but are stored and transmitted as an integer type. The auto-generator produces a class to wrap the type providing convenience functions. Arrays Arrays are fixed-length containers of other types. They must be type-homogeneous but can store any other single type. Serializables Serializables are field-value compositions of other types. They can be type-heterogeneous and may contain any other type as a value. The autocoder will generate a class with accessor methods for the fields. See the full specification for the serializable XML: F´ XML Specifications: Serializables C++ Classes When interacting only in the software and not within the F´ design layer, nor with the ground system the user may use arbitrary C++ class / struct types. If these types are to be passed through a port invocation as an argument, they should be defined as subclasses of the Fw::Serializable and define serialize and deserialize methods to be called to perform the serialization. Conclusion F´ supports many different types, including autocoded complex types. © 2020 California Institute of Technology. Government sponsorship acknowledged.

One Final Jig Test It is important that the satellite is as square as possible so that it will properly fit into its deployer. Just as before, slide the satellite through the Jig. Vibration Test To qualify for space, the satellite will need to complete a random vibration test, so that it may ride on the rocket. Check with your flight provider for more information about vibration testing. Long Range Communications Test To ensure the satellite is operating properly, it is important to see if the satellite can be heard from at distances greater than 50km. Thermal Vacuum Chamber Test To obtain an accurate idea of how the satellite will perform in space, the satellite should be exposed to extreme temperature shifts and vacuum environments.

Figure 1: The Battery Board V3 (left) and V2 (right) The PROVES Kit Battery Board was baselined on the PyCubed battery board, but has since evolved into more of a fully fledged EPS board. This is especially true of V3 and V3a which both host their own RP2040 microcontroller. Getting Started Currently there is one officially supported version of the batery board and one in development version: Version Flight Heritage Description V2a Pleiades - Yearling 2, Pleiades - Squared This version contains the core functionalities needed for battery and sensor management. V3 None This version is a significant overhaul of the battery board, and it implements a RP2040 microcontroller for power management. V3a None Removed the multiplexer and LED driver to make way for a switching 5V regulator. V3b None More bug fixes over V3a and the first board to be colored red. V3c None Changed the thermocouple IC to an SPI chip and added a real time clock.

For this purpose, there are a set of limit switches that can be attatched to the 2pos headers on the battery board that are thrown open when inside a deployer pod to cut off battery power from the satellite. Usually the requirement is only for two inhibits in series, but we use a 2s2p configuration for redundancy. Warning V2 and earlier battery boards are not ISS compliant as there is no low side inhibit switch that fully isolates the batteries from the rest of the electrical subsystems. Utilized Parts The battery board flown on the Pleiades-Yearling and Pleiades-Squared missions. The board serves as an interface with the rest of the satellite. A 12 position picolock is utilized to interface between the Flight Controller and the Battery Board. The board interfaces with 5 solar faces of the satellite using 5 position picolocks. The other 2 position picolocks are used for interfacing with the inhibit scheme, battery heater, burn wire, and direct charging port. The hardware utilized on the module is the following: LT3652 Solar Charger This component is used to charge the satellite's batteries using power harvested from solar panels. This part is not a true MPPT solar charger, but it emulates one. There is debate as to whether true MPPT is worth it on small 1U class satellites due to its extra complexity. In the future we will look towards using the microcontroller on the battery board to manage a true MPPT charging curcuit. Figure 2: The LT3652 Schematic PCA9685 LED Driver The PCA9685 LED Driver controls the power distribution to the solar faces. It enables selective powering of solar face components, facilitating isolation and power-down of specific faces in case of malfunction, thus protecting the system and conserving energy. Note In V3 of the battery board this circuit was moved to the Z- panel of the satellite. TCA9548 I2C Multiplexer The TCA9548 I2C Multiplexer expands a single I2C bus from the flight computer into multiple channels. This design simplifies the communication with multiple sensors on different solar faces while keeping their addresses identical, enhancing the modularity and scalability of the system. The TCA also appears to provide some level of bus protection, so in the case of an I2C sensor failure the fault is limited to only the face that the sensor is on rather than also interupting all other I2C sensors on the satellite. Note In V3 of the battery board this circuit was moved to the Z- panel of the satellite. TPS54226PWP Switching Voltage Regulator These two Switching Voltage Regulators are the primary regulator for supplying the microcontroller and sensors onboard the satellite. They creates a stable 3.3V and 5V power supply from the variable battery voltage, and its \"One Shot\" Regulator Reset feature provides a way to reset the power bus, aiding in system recovery and fault tolerance. This part is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed, and is believed to be slightly more radiation tolerant than other switching regulators due to there being a radiation hardened version in the part family. Figure 3: The 3.3V Regulator Schematic Figure 4: The 5V Switching Regulator Schematic Link to Datasheet TPS7A4501 LDO Voltage Regulator The TPS7A4501 LDO Voltage Regulator is essential for supplying a stable 5V power to critical components like the radio on the flight controller. Although a linear regulator is more inefficient than a switching one, there are significantly lower concerns of noise on the power lines. This is important for ensuring an electrically clean enviroment for the radio to operate in. This part is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed, and is believed to be slightly more radiation tolerant than other switching regulators due to there being a radiation hardened version in the part family. Figure 5: The 5V RF Regulator Schematic Link to Datasheet INA219 Power Monitors These Power Monitors are crucial for real-time tracking of power input from solar cells and power consumption across the system. They provide valuable data for monitoring the health of the electrical power system and for optimizing power usage. These power monitors have extensive flight heritage across many CubeSats. Figure 6: The INA Power Monitors Schematic PTC2075 Temperature Sensor The PTC2075 Temperature Sensor provides ambient temperature data from inside the satellite. This information is vital for thermal management, ensuring that the satellite's components operate within their safe temperature ranges. R5460N208AA The R5460N208AA plays a protective role by disconnecting the battery in cases of overcharge or overdischarge. This function is critical for battery health and safety, preventing potential damage to the power system. This part is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed. APAN3109 Relay The APAN3109 Relay is used to control the flow of current to the battery heater and burn wire MOSFETs. It is an essential component for managing the deployment mechanisms and thermal systems of the satellite. The Burn Wire Circuit Figure 6: The Burnwire and Heater Schematic In order to hold the antennas in a stowed position during launch we tie them off with a fishing line and use a nichrome wire to burn through that fishing line when it is time to deploy. This circuit is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed. The NDS8434 MOSFETS are fed battery voltage to their sources when the APAN relay is closed and the voltage that they transmit through to the burnwire is modulated using a PWM signal from the uController fed into the gate. Burnwire Burn Through If the power that flows through the NDS MOSFETs is too high the circuit will \"burn through\" and cause a short circuit that will trigger an overcurrent event any time battery voltage is introduced to the circuit. The attatched table from the ON Semi datasheet shows that although the max drain current is 6.5A, the MOSFET can only disapate between 1W and 2.5W. Right now, to consistently burn the burn wire we need to use a duty cycle of around 0.22 , which (assuming a wire resistance of ~0.3 Ohms and battery voltage of 8.0V) correlates to sending 8.53W through the circuit! Way higher than what is safe. We are currently looking at changing this entire circuit out for the V4 Battery Board. Known Issues Although the R5460N208AA is supposed to auto-release in the case of a battery protection event, it does not appear to actually do this. If you find that the satellite is not delivering power because of a battery protection event that has now been cleared, you can reset the protection circuit by \"jump starting\" the satellite by applying a voltage higher than the current voltage of the batteries. On-orbit these jump starts should be automatically applied by the solar charger, if they are needed.

Figure 1: The Battery Board V3 (left) and V2 (right) The PROVES Kit Battery Board was baselined on the PyCubed battery board, but has since evolved into more of a fully fledged EPS board. This is especially true of V3 and V3a which both host their own RP2040 microcontroller. Getting Started Currently there is one officially supported version of the batery board and one in development version: Version Flight Heritage Description V2a Pleiades - Yearling 2, Pleiades - Squared This version contains the core functionalities needed for battery and sensor management. V3 None This version is a significant overhaul of the battery board, and it implements a RP2040 microcontroller for power management. V3a None Removed the multiplexer and LED driver to make way for a switching 5V regulator. V3b None More bug fixes over V3a and the first board to be colored red. V3c None Changed the thermocouple IC to an SPI chip and added a real time clock.

For this purpose, there are a set of limit switches that can be attatched to the 2pos headers on the battery board that are thrown open when inside a deployer pod to cut off battery power from the satellite. Usually the requirement is only for two inhibits in series, but we use a 2s2p configuration for redundancy. Warning V2 and earlier battery boards are not ISS compliant as there is no low side inhibit switch that fully isolates the batteries from the rest of the electrical subsystems. Utilized Parts The battery board flown on the Pleiades-Yearling and Pleiades-Squared missions. The board serves as an interface with the rest of the satellite. A 12 position picolock is utilized to interface between the Flight Controller and the Battery Board. The board interfaces with 5 solar faces of the satellite using 5 position picolocks. The other 2 position picolocks are used for interfacing with the inhibit scheme, battery heater, burn wire, and direct charging port. The hardware utilized on the module is the following: LT3652 Solar Charger This component is used to charge the satellite's batteries using power harvested from solar panels. This part is not a true MPPT solar charger, but it emulates one. There is debate as to whether true MPPT is worth it on small 1U class satellites due to its extra complexity. In the future we will look towards using the microcontroller on the battery board to manage a true MPPT charging curcuit. Figure 2: The LT3652 Schematic PCA9685 LED Driver The PCA9685 LED Driver controls the power distribution to the solar faces. It enables selective powering of solar face components, facilitating isolation and power-down of specific faces in case of malfunction, thus protecting the system and conserving energy. Note In V3 of the battery board this circuit was moved to the Z- panel of the satellite. TCA9548 I2C Multiplexer The TCA9548 I2C Multiplexer expands a single I2C bus from the flight computer into multiple channels. This design simplifies the communication with multiple sensors on different solar faces while keeping their addresses identical, enhancing the modularity and scalability of the system. The TCA also appears to provide some level of bus protection, so in the case of an I2C sensor failure the fault is limited to only the face that the sensor is on rather than also interupting all other I2C sensors on the satellite. Note In V3 of the battery board this circuit was moved to the Z- panel of the satellite. TPS54226PWP Switching Voltage Regulator These two Switching Voltage Regulators are the primary regulator for supplying the microcontroller and sensors onboard the satellite. They creates a stable 3.3V and 5V power supply from the variable battery voltage, and its \"One Shot\" Regulator Reset feature provides a way to reset the power bus, aiding in system recovery and fault tolerance. This part is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed, and is believed to be slightly more radiation tolerant than other switching regulators due to there being a radiation hardened version in the part family. Figure 3: The 3.3V Regulator Schematic Figure 4: The 5V Switching Regulator Schematic Link to Datasheet TPS7A4501 LDO Voltage Regulator The TPS7A4501 LDO Voltage Regulator is essential for supplying a stable 5V power to critical components like the radio on the flight controller. Although a linear regulator is more inefficient than a switching one, there are significantly lower concerns of noise on the power lines. This is important for ensuring an electrically clean enviroment for the radio to operate in. This part is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed, and is believed to be slightly more radiation tolerant than other switching regulators due to there being a radiation hardened version in the part family. Figure 5: The 5V RF Regulator Schematic Link to Datasheet INA219 Power Monitors These Power Monitors are crucial for real-time tracking of power input from solar cells and power consumption across the system. They provide valuable data for monitoring the health of the electrical power system and for optimizing power usage. These power monitors have extensive flight heritage across many CubeSats. Figure 6: The INA Power Monitors Schematic PTC2075 Temperature Sensor The PTC2075 Temperature Sensor provides ambient temperature data from inside the satellite. This information is vital for thermal management, ensuring that the satellite's components operate within their safe temperature ranges. R5460N208AA The R5460N208AA plays a protective role by disconnecting the battery in cases of overcharge or overdischarge. This function is critical for battery health and safety, preventing potential damage to the power system. This part is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed. APAN3109 Relay The APAN3109 Relay is used to control the flow of current to the battery heater and burn wire MOSFETs. It is an essential component for managing the deployment mechanisms and thermal systems of the satellite. The Burn Wire Circuit Figure 6: The Burnwire and Heater Schematic In order to hold the antennas in a stowed position during launch we tie them off with a fishing line and use a nichrome wire to burn through that fishing line when it is time to deploy. This circuit is borrowed from Max Holliday's PyCubed. The NDS8434 MOSFETS are fed battery voltage to their sources when the APAN relay is closed and the voltage that they transmit through to the burnwire is modulated using a PWM signal from the uController fed into the gate. Burnwire Burn Through If the power that flows through the NDS MOSFETs is too high the circuit will \"burn through\" and cause a short circuit that will trigger an overcurrent event any time battery voltage is introduced to the circuit. The attatched table from the ON Semi datasheet shows that although the max drain current is 6.5A, the MOSFET can only disapate between 1W and 2.5W. Right now, to consistently burn the burn wire we need to use a duty cycle of around 0.22 , which (assuming a wire resistance of ~0.3 Ohms and battery voltage of 8.0V) correlates to sending 8.53W through the circuit! Way higher than what is safe. We are currently looking at changing this entire circuit out for the V4 Battery Board. Known Issues Although the R5460N208AA is supposed to auto-release in the case of a battery protection event, it does not appear to actually do this. If you find that the satellite is not delivering power because of a battery protection event that has now been cleared, you can reset the protection circuit by \"jump starting\" the satellite by applying a voltage higher than the current voltage of the batteries. On-orbit these jump starts should be automatically applied by the solar charger, if they are needed. The MOSFETS in the Burn Wire and Battery Heater Circuits have much lower power carrying capacity than they should for their application. This presents a relatively high risk of \"burning through\" the two circuits if they get too hot, especially in vacuum.
