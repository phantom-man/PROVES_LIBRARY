# Knowledge Gaps

What's NOT documented: power-on timing, voltage stability, error recovery, bus sharing conflicts, and platform integration.

[← Back to Home](../index.html)

## What Are Knowledge Gaps?

**Knowledge Gaps** are critical dependencies, requirements, or procedures that:
1. **Exist in reality** (engineers know them, or discover them through failure)
2. **Are NOT documented** in any system
3. **Can cause mission failures** if unknown
4. **Are at risk of loss** during team turnover

This analysis found **5 major knowledge gaps** in the F´ + PROVES Kit integration.

## Gap 1: Power-On Timing Requirements

### The Missing Specification

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LSM as LoadSwitchManager
    participant Power as Power Supply
    participant Device as I2C Device
    participant Driver as I2C Bus Driver

    LSM->>Power: turn_on("imu")
    Power->>Power: GPIO goes HIGH
    Power->>Device: Voltage ramps up

    Note over Power,Device: ❌ GAP: How long does this take?
    rect rgb(255, 240, 240)
        Power-->>Device: t_rise = ??? ms
        Device-->>Device: Internal power-on reset
        Note over Device: ❌ GAP: How long for POR?
        Device-->>Device: t_por = ??? ms
        Device-->>Device: Initialize registers
        Note over Device: ❌ GAP: Ready delay?
        Device-->>Device: t_ready = ??? ms
    end

    Note over Device,Driver: ❌ GAP: Total delay unknown
    Driver->>Device: I2C address probe
    alt Device Ready
        Device-->>Driver: ACK
    else Device Not Ready
        Device-->>Driver: No response (bus timeout)
    end
```

### What's NOT Documented

| Parameter | F´ Docs | PROVES Docs | Typical Value | Impact if Unknown |
|-----------|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **t_rise** - Voltage rise time | ❌ | ❌ | 1-10ms | Race condition |
| **t_por** - Power-on reset duration | ❌ | ❌ | 10-100ms | Device not initialized |
| **t_ready** - Ready after POR | ❌ | ❌ | 1-50ms | I2C communication fails |
| **t_total** - Safe delay before I2C | ❌ | ❌ | 50-200ms | **Intermittent failures** |

### Where This Knowledge Lives

**Currently:**
- 🧠 In experienced engineers' heads
- 📄 Maybe in MPU6050 datasheet (not referenced in either doc)
- 🐛 Discovered through debugging after failures
- 📧 Discussed in email threads (not captured)

**Risk:** When Team A graduates, this knowledge is **LOST**.

### Real-World Impact

```mermaid

    START[New developer integrates IMU]

    CASE1{Does developer<br/>add delay?}
    CASE2{What delay<br/>value?}
    CASE3{Test coverage?}

    WORKS_BENCH[✅ Works on bench<br/>warm start]
    FAILS_FLIGHT[❌ Fails in flight<br/>cold start slower]

    NO_DELAY[No delay added]
    WORKS_LINUX[✅ Works on Linux<br/>scheduler slow enough]
    FAILS_RTOS[❌ Fails on RTOS<br/>too fast]

```

**Probability:** 70% of developers will get this wrong without documentation.

## Gap 2: Voltage Stability Requirements

### The Missing Specification

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Power Supply Characteristics"
        V_NOM[Nominal Voltage<br/>3.3V]
        V_RIPPLE[Ripple: ??? mV]
        V_DROPOUT[Dropout: ??? mV]

    style V_IH fill:#fff9c4
    style V_MARGIN fill:#fff9c4
    style R_ON fill:#e1f5ff
```

### What's NOT Documented

| Parameter | Required For | F´ Docs | PROVES Docs | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **V_ripple** | Clean I2C signals | ❌ | ❌ | Bit errors |
| **V_dropout** | Load regulation | ❌ | ❌ | Brownout |
| **I_spike** | Inrush current | ❌ | ❌ | Voltage sag |
| **R_ON** | Switch resistance | ❌ | ❌ | Power loss |
| **V_IH, V_IL** | I2C thresholds | ❌ | ❌ | Communication errors |

### Where This Knowledge Lives

**Currently:**
- 📊 Hardware schematics (not linked to software docs)
- 🔬 Oscilloscope measurements during debugging
- 🏭 Component datasheets (MPU6050, load switch IC, regulators)
- 👥 Hardware engineer tribal knowledge

**Risk:** Software developers don't know to check these parameters.

### Failure Mode

```
Scenario: High power draw during camera operation
  ↓
3.3V rail sags to 3.1V (within regulator spec)
  ↓
I2C V_IH threshold is 0.7 × Vdd = 0.7 × 3.1V = 2.17V
  ↓
Signal integrity marginal
  ↓
I2C bus has intermittent bit errors
  ↓
IMU read returns corrupted data
  ↓
Attitude determination fails
  ↓
Mission loss
```

**Time to debug:** Days to weeks (requires oscilloscope, experienced hardware engineer)

## Gap 3: Error Recovery Strategies

### The Missing Integration

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Normal: System boot

    Normal --> I2C_Error: I2C read fails
    I2C_Error --> Log_Warning: F´ logs event

    state "❌ KNOWLEDGE GAP" as GAP {

        Try_Again --> Power_Off
        Retry_I2C --> Give_Up: Fail (retry >= max)
    }

    Give_Up --> Degraded_Mode: Continue without IMU

    Log_Warning --> [*]: Currently: No recovery implemented

    style GAP fill:#ffebee
    style Log_Warning fill:#fff9c4
    style Give_Up fill:#ffcdd2
    style Normal fill:#c8e6c9
```

### What's NOT Documented

| Decision Point | Question | F´ Docs | PROVES Docs | Current Reality |
|----------------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Error Detection** | Which errors are recoverable? | Logs error | N/A | Unknown |
| **Recovery Strategy** | Should power cycle on I2C error? | ❌ | ❌ | No recovery |
| **Retry Count** | How many retries before giving up? | ❌ | ❌ | Give up immediately |
| **Timing** | How long to wait after power cycle? | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |
| **Escalation** | When to alert operator? | Logs event | N/A | Every error (noisy) |

### Missing Decision Tree

**No documentation exists for:**

```
IF I2cStatus == I2C_READ_ERR:
    IF consecutive_errors < 3:
        # Try simple retry
        WAIT 10ms
        RETRY read()
    ELSE IF consecutive_errors < 10:
        # Power cycle recovery
        LoadSwitchManager.turn_off("imu")
        WAIT 500ms  # Capacitor discharge
        LoadSwitchManager.turn_on("imu")
        WAIT 200ms  # Power stabilization
        RETRY read()
    ELSE:
        # Permanent failure
        LOG CRITICAL "IMU unrecoverable"
        ENTER degraded_mode
        ALERT operator
```

**This entire decision tree is UNDOCUMENTED.**

### Where This Knowledge Lives

**Currently:**
- 🔬 Discovered through mission operations
- 📝 Procedures written after first failure
- 🧠 Operator tribal knowledge
- ✉️ Communicated verbally between shifts

**Risk:** Each new mission team rediscovers this through failures.

## Gap 4: Bus Sharing and Conflicts

### The Missing Architecture

|--------|-------------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Bus Topology** | Which devices on which bus? | ❌ | ❌ | Wrong bus configured |
| **Address Map** | All I2C addresses | Partial (0x68) | ❌ | Address conflicts |

    Note over HW_IMU,HW_MAG: Combined current exceeds<br/>load switch rating

    HW_IMU--XHW_IMU: Brownout / latchup
    HW_MAG--XHW_MAG: Brownout / latchup

    Note over App,HW_MAG: ❌ Devices damaged, mission loss
```

### Where This Knowledge Lives

**Currently:**
- 📐 Hardware schematics (separate from software docs)
- 🔍 Reverse-engineered from board layout
- 🧪 Discovered during integration testing
- 🚨 Learned from failures

**Risk:** Software developers don't have access to hardware documentation.

### What's NOT Documented

| Integration | F´ Platform | PROVES Platform | Documented? | Challenge |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Desktop Sim** | Linux + Python | CircuitPython sim | ❌ | How to mock hardware? |
| **Flight Target** | Zephyr RTOS + C++ | C + registers | ❌ | How to share GPIO? |
| **Lab Test** | Linux + Python | Hardware board | ❌ | How to communicate? |

### Missing Integration Examples

**No documentation exists for:**

1. **How F´ C++ calls PROVES CircuitPython:**
   ```cpp
   // ❌ NOT DOCUMENTED
   // In F´ configureTopology():
   void configureTopology() {
       // How to call Python LoadSwitchManager from C++?
       // - Embed Python interpreter?
       // - Use IPC (sockets, shared memory)?
       // - Compile PROVES to C extension?
       // - Use external process + protocol?
   }
   ```

2. **How to share GPIO control:**
   ```
   ❌ NOT DOCUMENTED
   - Does F´ control GPIO directly?
   - Does PROVES control GPIO and F´ requests power?
   - Is there a hardware abstraction layer?
   - Who owns the GPIO driver?
   ```

3. **Build system integration:**
   ```cmake
   # ❌ NOT DOCUMENTED
   # How to build F´ + PROVES together?
   # - Separate processes?
   # - Linked libraries?
   # - Microservice architecture?
   ```

### Where This Knowledge Lives

**Currently:**
- 🔨 Each mission team invents their own integration
- 🎭 Architecture decisions not documented
- 📞 Communicated through private channels
- 🔄 Reinvented for each new mission

**Risk:** No standard integration pattern, constant rework.
