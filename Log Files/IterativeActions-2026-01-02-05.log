2026-01-02 05:24:51 - Started log for the 05 hour block; investigating why fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 fails to reduce markdownlint errors in MERMAID_RULES.md. Next: add the missing Test-MD055MD056 validator and re-run script.
2026-01-02 05:26:10 - Added Test-MD055MD056 validator to fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 so MD055/MD056 checks stop failing; will rerun the script on docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md to verify fixes now persist.
2026-01-02 05:30:36 - Rerunning revealed Main never accepts FilePath because it lacks parameters and the script never invokes Main; need to add a script-level param block and call Main with the provided FilePath.
2026-01-02 05:31:01 - Added a script-level FilePath parameter, updated Main to accept it, and appended a Main invocation so the script now runs when executed with -FilePath.
2026-01-02 05:32:19 - Updated Set-MD012 and Set-MD022 to use mutable string lists so their RemoveAt operations no longer throw when trimming blank lines; retrying the script next.
2026-01-02 05:33:25 - Removed the temp-file git logging inside Set-MD012/Test-MD012 so the script no longer tries to git add files outside the repo during runs.
2026-01-02 05:34:11 - Script run still fails because Backup-File/Restore-File emit git output, causing non-string values to propagate; need to silence their git add/commit output so backup paths stay as simple strings.
2026-01-02 05:34:35 - Quieted git add/commit calls in Backup-File/Restore-File/Remove-Backup so the helper returns clean string paths.
2026-01-02 05:35:42 - Ran fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 against docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md; it completed with only MD022 warnings, so content updates were written for further review.
2026-01-02 05:41:24 - Preparing to clean literal "\\n" prefixes in docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md headings to resolve remaining MD022 warnings.
2026-01-02 05:42:28 - Rewrote docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md to convert leading literal "\\n" tokens into real blank lines so headings meet MD022 spacing rules.
2026-01-02 05:43:46 - Rerunning fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 on docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md to verify MD022 now passes and other rules stay clean.
2026-01-02 05:44:37 - Identified MD022 validator ignores indented code fences; updating fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 to treat lines starting with whitespace + ``` as code blocks.
2026-01-02 05:45:09 - Updated all code-fence detection regexes in fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 to allow leading whitespace so MD022 and related rules respect indented blocks.
2026-01-02 05:45:33 - Re-running fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 on docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md to confirm MD022 passes with the improved code-fence handling.
2026-01-02 05:50:11 - Run still reported MD022 because Set/Test-MD022 only recognized empty headings; refactoring both functions to detect real headings and enforce true blank lines.
2026-01-02 05:50:22 - Updated Set-MD022/Test-MD022 to skip indented code blocks, detect actual headings, and insert blank lines only when necessary.
2026-01-02 05:50:43 - Re-running fix_markdownlint_robust_v3.ps1 on docs/diagrams/MERMAID_RULES.md with the new MD022 logic.
2026-01-02 05:51:02 - Script completed with no MD022 warnings; confirming resulting doc before finalizing.
