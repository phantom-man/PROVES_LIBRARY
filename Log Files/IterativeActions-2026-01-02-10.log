2026-01-02 10:21:29 - Started log for the 10 hour block; preparing to push local main branch to fork per user request.
2026-01-02 10:21:59 - Ran git status to verify readiness for push; branch main is 25 commits ahead of origin with a clean working tree. Next: stage the new log entry before pushing.
2026-01-02 10:22:03 - Tried staging the new log via git add using the GitKraken tool twice but it failed with exit status 1, likely due to the space in the path; will fall back to a direct CLI git add.
2026-01-02 10:22:51 - Forced git add on the new log because Log Files is ignored so staging failed otherwise; staging succeeded after using -f.
2026-01-02 10:22:53 - Committed the initial 10-hour log entries with message "Start 2026-01-02 10h iterative log"; proceeding with the push workflow next.
2026-01-02 10:23:38 - Attempted `git push origin main` but it failed with "Could not resolve host: github.com"; need to investigate connectivity or retry once the network is available.
